  abstract = {There is a tightly coupled bidirectional interaction between visual cortex and visual thalamus [lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)]. Using drifting sinusoidal grating stimuli, we compared the response of cells in the LGN with and without feedback from the visual cortex. Raster plots revealed a striking difference in the response pattern of cells with and without feedback. This difference was reflected in the results from computing vector sum plots and the ratio of zero harmonic to the fundamental harmonic of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) for these responses. The variability of responses assessed by using the Fano factor was also different for the two groups, with the cells without feedback showing higher variability. We examined the covariance of these measures between pairs of simultaneously recorded cells with and without feedback, and they were much more strongly positively correlated with feedback. We constructed orientation tuning curves from the central 5 ms in the raw cross-correlograms of the outputs of pairs of LGN cells, and these curves revealed much sharper tuning with feedback. We discuss the significance of these data for cortical function and suggest that the precision in stimulus-linked firing in the LGN appears as an emergent factor from the corticothalamic interaction.},

  abstract = {Feedback connections to early-level sensory neurons have been shown to affect many characteristics of their neural response. Because selectivity for stimulus size is a fundamental property of visual neurons, we examined the summation tuning and discretely mapped receptive field (RF) properties of cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) both with and without feedback from visual cortex. Using extracellular recording in halothane-anesthetized cats, we used small luminance probes displaced in Cartesian coordinates to measure discrete response area, and optimal sinusoidal gratings of varying diameter to estimate preferred optimal summation size and level of center-surround antagonism. In conditions where most cortical feedback was pharmacologically removed, discretely mapped RF response areas showed an overall significant enlargement for the population compared with control conditions. A switch to increased levels of burst firing, spatially displaced from the RF center, suggested this was mediated by changes in excitatory-inhibitory balance across visual space. With the use of coextensive stimulation, there were overall highly significant increases in the optimal summation size and reduction of surround antagonism with removal of cortical feedback in the LGN. When fitted with a difference-of-Gaussian (DOG) model, changes in the center size, center amplitude, and surround amplitude parameters were most significantly related to the removal of cortical feedback. In summary, corticothalamic innervation of the visual thalamus can modify spatial summation properties in LGN relay cells, an effect most parsimoniously explained by changes in the excitatory-inhibitory balance.},

SM is the ability of stimuli in the surround of a neuron's receptive field (RF) to modulate (typically suppress) the neuron's response to stimuli simultaneously presented inside the RF, a property thought to underlie optimal coding of sensory information and important perceptual functions. Understanding the circuit and mechanisms for SM can reveal fundamental principles of computations in sensory cortices, from mouse to human. Current debate is centered over whether feedforward or intracortical circuits generate SM, and whether this results from increased inhibition or reduced excitation. Here we present a working hypothesis, based on theoretical and experimental evidence, that SM results from feedforward, horizontal, and feedback interactions with local recurrent connections, via synaptic mechanisms involving both increased inhibition and reduced recurrent excitation. In particular, strong and balanced recurrent excitatory and inhibitory circuits play a crucial role in the computation of SM.},

Modality refers to the way in which something happens or is experienced and a research problem is characterized as multimodal when it includes multiple such modalities. In order for Artificial Intelligence to make progress in understanding the world around us, it needs to be able to interpret such multimodal signals together. Multimodal machine learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential. Instead of focusing on specific multimodal applications, this paper surveys the recent advances in multimodal machine learning itself and presents them in a common taxonomy. We go beyond the typical early and late fusion categorization and identify broader challenges that are faced by multimodal machine learning, namely: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and co-learning. This new taxonomy will enable researchers to better understand the state of the field and identify directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Brain activity patterns exhibited during task performance have been shown to spontaneously reemerge in the following restful awake state. Such “awake reactivation” has been observed across higher-order cortex for complex images or associations. However, it is still unclear whether the reactivation extends to primary sensory areas that encode simple stimulus features. To address this question, we trained human subjects from both sexes on a particular visual feature (Gabor orientation) and tested whether this feature will be reactivated immediately after training. We found robust reactivation in human V1 that lasted for at least 8 min after training offset. This effect was not present in higher retinotopic areas, such as V2, V3, V3A, or V4v. Further analyses suggested that the amount of awake reactivation was related to the amount of performance improvement on the visual task. These results demonstrate that awake reactivation extends beyond higher-order areas and also occurs in early sensory cortex.                            SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT               How do we acquire new memories and skills? New information is known to be consolidated during offline periods of rest. Recent studies suggest that a critical process during this period of consolidation is the spontaneous reactivation of previously experienced patterns of neural activity. However, research in humans has mostly examined such reactivation processes in higher-order cortex. Here we show that awake reactivation occurs even in the primary visual cortex V1 and that this reactivation is related to the amount of behavioral learning. These results pinpoint awake reactivation as a process that likely occurs across the entire human brain and could play an integral role in memory consolidation.},

  abstract = {Deep neural networks have achieved impressive successes in fields ranging from object recognition to complex games such as Go1,2. Navigation, however, remains a substantial challenge for artificial agents, with deep neural networks trained by reinforcement learning3–5 failing to rival the proficiency of mammalian spatial behaviour, which is underpinned by grid cells in the entorhinal cortex6. Grid cells are thought to provide a multi-scale periodic representation that functions as a metric for coding space7,8 and is critical for integrating self-motion (path integration)6,7,9 and planning direct trajectories to goals (vector-based navigation)7,10,11. Here we set out to leverage the computational functions of grid cells to develop a deep reinforcement learning agent with mammal-like navigational abilities. We first trained a recurrent network to perform path integration, leading to the emergence of representations resembling grid cells, as well as other entorhinal cell types12. We then showed that this representation provided an effective basis for an agent to locate goals in challenging, unfamiliar, and changeable environments—optimizing the primary objective of navigation through deep reinforcement learning. The performance of agents endowed with grid-like representations surpassed that of an expert human and comparison agents, with the metric quantities necessary for vector-based navigation derived from grid-like units within the network. Furthermore, grid-like representations enabled agents to conduct shortcut behaviours reminiscent of those performed by mammals. Our findings show that emergent grid-like representations furnish agents with a Euclidean spatial metric and associated vector operations, providing a foundation for proficient navigation. As such, our results support neuroscientific theories that see grid cells as critical for vector-based navigation7,10,11, demonstrating that the latter can be combined with path-based strategies to support navigation in challenging environments.},

  abstract = {Particular deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) are today’s most accurate models of the primate brain’s ventral visual stream. Using an ANN-driven image synthesis method, we found that luminous power patterns (i.e., images) can be applied to primate retinae to predictably push the spiking activity of targeted V4 neural sites beyond naturally occurring levels. This method, although not yet perfect, achieves unprecedented independent control of the activity state of entire populations of V4 neural sites, even those with overlapping receptive fields. These results show how the knowledge embedded in today’s ANN models might be used to noninvasively set desired internal brain states at neuron-level resolution, and suggest that more accurate ANN models would produce even more accurate control.},

  abstract = {Visual awareness has been proposed to depend on recurrent processing in early visual cortex areas including the primary visual cortex (V1). Here, we address this hypothesis with high spatiotemporal resolution magnetoencephalographic recordings in subjects performing a substitution masking paradigm. Neural activity reflecting awareness is assessed by directly comparing the neuromagnetic response elicited by effectively and ineffectively masked targets after the proportion of trials leading to masking was individually adjusted to match the proportion of trials without masking. This revealed a modulation of recurrent activity in the primary visual cortex rapidly after the onset of the feedforward sweep of processing in striate and extrastriate areas but significantly before the onset of attention-dependent recurrent modulations in V1. Our data provide direct support for the notion that (               i               ) recurrent processing in V1 correlates with visual awareness and (               ii               ) that attention and awareness involve distinct recurrent processing operations.},

Frontoparietal activation has also been found in studies of subliminal stimulus processing. We hypothesized that an impairment of top-down processes, involved in recurrent neuronal message-passing and the generation of long-latency electrophysiological responses, might provide a more reliable correlate of consciousness in severely brain-damaged patients, than frontoparietal responses. We measured effective connectivity during a mismatch negativity paradigm and found that the only significant difference between patients in a vegetative state and controls was an impairment of backward connectivity from frontal to temporal cortices. This result emphasizes the importance of top-down projections in recurrent processing that involve high-order associative cortices for conscious perception.},

The pattern of motion that we see allows us to estimate our heading accurately in a variety of environments, despite the added difficulty imposed by our own eye and head movements. The cortical substrates for heading perception include the medial superior temporal area (MST) and the ventral intraparietal area (VIP). This review discusses recent work on these two areas in the context of behavioral observations that establish the important problems the visual system must solve. Signals relevant to self motion are both more widespread than heretofore recognized and also more complex because they are multiplexed with other sensory signals, such as vestibular, auditory, and tactile information. The review presents recent work as a background to highlight important problems that remain unsolved.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The free energy principle, an influential framework in computational neuroscience and theoretical neurobiology, starts from the assumption that living systems ensure adaptive exchanges with their environment by minimizing the objective function of variational free energy. Following this premise, it claims to deliver a promising integration of the life sciences. In recent work, Markov blankets, one of the central constructs of the free energy principle, have been applied to resolve debates central to philosophy (such as demarcating the boundaries of the mind). The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we trace the development of Markov blankets starting from their standard application in Bayesian networks, via variational inference, to their use in the literature on active inference. We then identify a persistent confusion in the literature between the formal use of Markov blankets as an epistemic tool for Bayesian inference, and their novel metaphysical use in the free energy framework to demarcate the physical boundary between an agent and its environment. Consequently, we propose to distinguish between “Pearl blankets” to refer to the original epistemic use of Markov blankets and “Friston blankets” to refer to the new metaphysical construct. Second, we use this distinction to critically assess claims resting on the application of Markov blankets to philosophical problems. We suggest that this literature would do well in differentiating between two different research programmes: “inference with a model” and “inference within a model.” Only the latter is capable of doing metaphysical work with Markov blankets, but requires additional philosophical premises and cannot be justified by an appeal to the success of the mathematical framework alone.},

  abstract = {We can claim that we know what the visual system does once we can predict neural responses to arbitrary stimuli, including those seen in nature. In the early visual system, models based on one or more linear receptive fields hold promise to achieve this goal as long as the models include nonlinear mechanisms that control responsiveness, based on stimulus context and history, and take into account the nonlinearity of spike generation. These linear and nonlinear mechanisms might be the only essential determinants of the response, or alternatively, there may be additional fundamental determinants yet to be identified. Research is progressing with the goals of defining a single “standard model” for each stage of the visual pathway and testing the predictive power of these models on the responses to movies of natural scenes. These predictive models represent, at a given stage of the visual pathway, a compact description of visual computation. They would be an invaluable guide for understanding the underlying biophysical and anatomical mechanisms and relating neural responses to visual perception.},

  abstract = {Neurons in the dorsal subdivision of the medial superior temporal area (MSTd) show directionally selective responses to both visual (optic flow) and vestibular stimuli that correspond to translational or rotational movements of the subject. Previous work has shown that MSTd neurons are clustered within the cortex according to their directional preferences for optic flow, suggesting that there may be a topographic mapping of self-motion vectors in MSTd. If MSTd provides a multisensory representation of self-motion information, then MSTd neurons may also be expected to show clustering according to their directional preferences for vestibular signals, but this has not been tested previously. We have examined clustering of vestibular signals by comparing the tuning of isolated single units (SUs) with the undifferentiated multiunit (MU) activity of several neighboring neurons recorded from the same microelectrode. We find that directional preferences for both translational and rotational vestibular stimuli, like those for optic flow, are clustered within area MSTd. MU activity often shows significant tuning for vestibular stimuli, although this MU selectivity is generally weaker for translation than for rotation. When directional tuning is observed in MU activity, the direction preference generally agrees closely with that of a simultaneously recorded SU. We also examined clustering of visual receptive field properties in MSTd by analyzing receptive field maps obtained using a reverse-correlation technique. We find that both the local directional preferences and overall spatial receptive field profiles are well clustered in MSTd. Overall, our findings have implications for how visual and vestibular signals regarding self-motion may be decoded from populations of MSTd neurons.},

  abstract = {Despite their outstanding performance in a broad spectrum of real-world tasks, deep artificial neural networks are sensitive to input noises, particularly adversarial perturbations. On the contrary, human and animal brains are much less vulnerable. In contrast to the one-shot inference performed by most deep neural networks, the brain often solves decision-making with an evidence accumulation mechanism that may trade time for accuracy when facing noisy inputs. The mechanism is well described by the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM). In the DDM, decision-making is modeled as a process in which noisy evidence is accumulated toward a threshold. Drawing inspiration from the DDM, we propose the Dropout-based Drift-Diffusion Model (DDDM) that combines test-phase dropout and the DDM for improving the robustness for arbitrary neural networks. The dropouts create temporally uncorrelated noises in the network that counter perturbations, while the evidence accumulation mechanism guarantees a reasonable decision accuracy. Neural networks enhanced with the DDDM tested in image, speech, and text classification tasks all significantly outperform their native counterparts, demonstrating the DDDM as a task-agnostic defense against adversarial attacks.},

  abstract = {The brain often has to make decisions based on information stored in working memory, but the neural circuitry underlying working memory is not fully understood. Many theoretical efforts have been focused on modeling the persistent delay period activity in the prefrontal areas that is believed to represent working memory. Recent experiments reveal that the delay period activity in the prefrontal cortex is neither static nor homogeneous as previously assumed. Models based on reservoir networks have been proposed to model such a dynamical activity pattern. The connections between neurons within a reservoir are random and do not require explicit tuning. Information storage does not depend on the stable states of the network. However, it is not clear how the encoded information can be retrieved for decision making with a biologically realistic algorithm. We therefore built a reservoir-based neural network to model the neuronal responses of the prefrontal cortex in a somatosensory delayed discrimination task. We first illustrate that the neurons in the reservoir exhibit a heterogeneous and dynamical delay period activity observed in previous experiments. Then we show that a cluster population circuit decodes the information from the reservoir with a winner-take-all mechanism and contributes to the decision making. Finally, we show that the model achieves a good performance rapidly by shaping only the readout with reinforcement learning. Our model reproduces important features of previous behavior and neurophysiology data. We illustrate for the first time how task-specific information stored in a reservoir network can be retrieved with a biologically plausible reinforcement learning training scheme.},

  abstract = {The mechanical properties of the viscoelastic damper made of high damping rubber produced in China are investigated in order to provide the basis for its application. At first, the test on material properties of high damping rubber is conducted. The Mooney–Rivlin model, the Yeoh model and the Prony series are applied for simulating the nonlinear behavior of the high damping rubber with the aid of software ABAQUS. Then, three viscoelastic dampers with different sizes are tested under cyclic loading. The effects of strain amplitude and loading frequency on hysteretic behavior of dampers are analyzed. Viscoelastic dampers possess large deformation capability, stable energy-dissipation capacity and good fatigue-resisting property. The effect of strain amplitude is much more significant than loading frequency. The hysteretic behavior of the dampers is simulated by the Bouc–Wen model and the model of the equivalent stiffness and damping, respectively. The prediction results by using the Bouc–Wen model are in good agreement with the experimental results, which indicates that the Bouc–Wen model is applicable to simulate the mechanical properties of high damping viscoelastic dampers with a wide range of shear strain. As to the model of equivalent stiffness and damping, it has the advantages of clear concept and simple calculation. However, the good accuracy of prediction can be obtained only when the shear strain is not greater than 60\%.},

METHODS: With 14 active cup electrodes, and full and half field stimulation, the checkerboard pattern was reversed and the VEPs were recorded in control and experimental groups. RESULTS: With full field stimulation, the latent period 1 (LP1) of binocular VEPs was not longer and the amplitude N1-P1 (AN1P1) not higher respectively than those of monocular VEPs in experimental group. These properties were different from those of control group. The AN1P1 of non-dominant eye was decreased, and the LP1 of dominant and non-dominant eye was longer in experimental group than that of the control group. There were no significant differences in comparing LP1 and AN1P1 between nasal-retina and temporal-retina of experimental group. CONCLUSIONS: VEPs can provide a scientific basis for abnormal binocular vision in constant exotropia. Although the visual acuity of constant exotropic children is normal, their VEPs are abnormal. Therefore, there might be dysfunction in primary visual cortex. With half field stimulation, there is no suppression of temporal-retina in monocular VEPs of constant exotropic children.},

  abstract = {Significance             The visual system is often presented with degraded and partial visual information; thus, it must extensively fill in details not present in the physical input. Does the visual system fill in object-specific information as an object’s features change in motion? Here, we show that object-specific features (orientation) can be reconstructed from neural activity in early visual cortex (V1) while objects undergo dynamic transformations. Furthermore, our results suggest that this information is not generated by averaging the physically present stimuli or by mechanisms involved in visual imagery, which also requires internal reconstruction of information not physically present. Our study provides evidence that V1 plays a unique role in dynamic filling-in of integrated visual information during kinetic object transformations via feedback signals.           ,              As raw sensory data are partial, our visual system extensively fills in missing details, creating enriched percepts based on incomplete bottom-up information. Despite evidence for internally generated representations at early stages of cortical processing, it is not known whether these representations include missing information of dynamically transforming objects. Long-range apparent motion (AM) provides a unique test case because objects in AM can undergo changes both in position and in features. Using fMRI and encoding methods, we found that the “intermediate” orientation of an apparently rotating grating, never presented in the retinal input but interpolated during AM, is reconstructed in population-level, feature-selective tuning responses in the region of early visual cortex (V1) that corresponds to the retinotopic location of the AM path. This neural representation is absent when AM inducers are presented simultaneously and when AM is visually imagined. Our results demonstrate dynamic filling-in in V1 for object features that are interpolated during kinetic transformations.},

They are bundles of cells that support perception and action by constantly attempting to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down expectations or predictions. This is achieved using a hierarchical generative model that aims to minimize prediction error within a bidirectional cascade of cortical processing. Such accounts offer a unifying model of perception and action, illuminate the functional role of attention, and may neatly capture the special contribution of cortical processing to adaptive success. This target article critically examines this “hierarchical prediction machine” approach, concluding that it offers the best clue yet to the shape of a unified science of mind and action. Sections 1 and 2 lay out the key elements and implications of the approach. Section 3 explores a variety of pitfalls and challenges, spanning the evidential, the methodological, and the more properly conceptual. The paper ends (sections 4 and 5) by asking how such approaches might impact our more general vision of mind, experience, and agency.},

Whether view cells are present in other brain areas, and how view selectivity interacts with other variables such as object features and place remain unclear. Here, we explore these issues by recording the responses of neurons in the HPC and the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) of rhesus macaques performing a task in which they learn new context‐object associations while navigating a virtual environment using a joystick. We measured neuronal responses at different locations in a virtual maze where animals freely directed gaze to different regions of the visual scenes. We show that specific views containing task relevant objects selectively activated a proportion of HPC units, and an even higher proportion of LPFC units. Place selectivity was scarce and generally dependent on view. Many view cells were not affected by changing the object color or the context cue, two task relevant features. However, a small proportion of view cells showed selectivity for these two features. Our results show that during navigation in a virtual environment with complex and dynamic visual stimuli, view cells are found in both the HPC and the LPFC. View cells may have developed as a multiarea specialization in diurnal primates to encode the complexities and layouts of the environment through gaze exploration which ultimately enables building cognitive maps of space that guide navigation.},

  abstract = {Since its introduction, the reward prediction error theory of dopamine has explained a wealth of empirical phenomena, providing a unifying framework for understanding the representation of reward and value in the brain1–3. According to the now canonical theory, reward predictions are represented as a single scalar quantity, which supports learning about the expectation, or mean, of stochastic outcomes. Here we propose an account of dopamine-based reinforcement learning inspired by recent artificial intelligence research on distributional reinforcement learning4–6. We hypothesized that the brain represents possible future rewards not as a single mean, but instead as a probability distribution, effectively representing multiple future outcomes simultaneously and in parallel. This idea implies a set of empirical predictions, which we tested using single-unit recordings from mouse ventral tegmental area. Our findings provide strong evidence for a neural realization of distributional reinforcement learning.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Neural decoding can be conceptualized as the problem of mapping brain responses back to sensory stimuli via a feature space. We introduce (i) a novel experimental paradigm that uses well-controlled yet highly naturalistic stimuli with a priori known feature representations and (ii) an implementation thereof for HYPerrealistic reconstruction of PERception (HYPER) of faces from brain recordings. To this end, we embrace the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) at the earliest step of our neural decoding pipeline by acquiring fMRI data as participants perceive face images synthesized by the generator network of a GAN. We show that the latent vectors used for generation effectively capture the same defining stimulus properties as the fMRI measurements. As such, these latents (conditioned on the GAN) are used as the in-between feature representations underlying the perceived images that can be predicted in neural decoding for (re-)generation of the originally perceived stimuli, leading to the most accurate reconstructions of perception to date.},

Vision frequently dominates the integrated visual–haptic percept, for example when judging size, shape or position1,2,3, but in some circumstances the percept is clearly affected by haptics4,5,6,7. Here we propose that a general principle, which minimizes variance in the final estimate, determines the degree to which vision or haptics dominates. This principle is realized by using maximum-likelihood estimation8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 to combine the inputs. To investigate cue combination quantitatively, we first measured the variances associated with visual and haptic estimation of height. We then used these measurements to construct a maximum-likelihood integrator. This model behaved very similarly to humans in a visual–haptic task. Thus, the nervous system seems to combine visual and haptic information in a fashion that is similar to a maximum-likelihood integrator. Visual dominance occurs when the variance associated with visual estimation is lower than that associated with haptic estimation.},

We report here on (1) a summary of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31\% of the possible number of pathways if each area were connected with all others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40\%. The great majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections between areas. There are also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40\%. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somatosensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive than those suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships (about 10\% of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances, though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainities in the reported assignment.},

  abstract = {Integration of multiple sensory cues is crucial for adaptive behaviour, but understanding its neural basis has been hampered by a divergence in the literature into two largely non-overlapping conceptual approaches. One approach seeks to predict and quantify cue integration behaviour in a rigorous psychophysical framework, whereas the other has focused on the empirical principles that govern multisensory integration by neurons, including its anatomical and developmental origins.Tasked with reconciling these camps are the computational theorists who strive to create models of multisensory processing that are both biologically realistic and capable of explaining psychophysical performance. Progress has been made on this front, an example of which is the theory of probabilistic population coding. However, several obstacles remain, such as accounting for key differences between model predictions and neurophysiological data and a lack of neuronal recordings from behaving animals performing psychophysical cue integration tasks.A recent set of studies on the integration of visual and vestibular cues for self-motion perception draws from both sets of approaches and has attempted to narrow the conceptual gap between them. This work uses macaque monkeys trained to report their heading direction in a virtual-reality apparatus, while researchers monitor single-unit activity in a multisensory region of the extrastriate visual cortex (the dorsal medial superior temporal area (MSTd)).The emerging picture is one in which computations performed by multisensory neurons in area MSTd can be linked to psychophysical performance and may also help to explain the empirical principles that have driven the field for two decades. Divisive normalization, a common property of neuronal circuits, may be one of the key computations that give rise to the desired behaviour.Further work will be needed to develop more complete models that connect the neurobiological details of multisensory integration with the probabilistic computations underlying cue integration performance and perception in general.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that many neurons in the primate dorsal medial superior temporal area (MSTd) show spatial tuning during inertial motion and that these responses are vestibular in origin. Given their well-studied role in processing visual self-motion cues (i.e., optic flow), these neurons may be involved in the integration of visual and vestibular signals to facilitate robust perception of self-motion. However, the temporal structure of vestibular responses in MSTd has not been characterized in detail. Specifically, it is not known whether MSTd neurons encode velocity, acceleration, or some combination of motion parameters not explicitly encoded by vestibular afferents. In this study, we have applied a frequency-domain analysis to single-unit responses during translation in three dimensions (3D). The analysis quantifies the stimulus-driven temporal modulation of each response as well as the degree to which this modulation reflects the velocity and/or acceleration profile of the stimulus. We show that MSTd neurons signal a combination of velocity and acceleration components with the velocity component being stronger for most neurons. These two components can exist both within and across motion directions, although their spatial tuning did not show a systematic relationship across the population. From these results, vestibular responses in MSTd appear to show characteristic features of spatiotemporal convergence, similar to previous findings in the brain stem and thalamus. The predominance of velocity encoding in this region may reflect the suitability of these signals to be integrated with visual signals regarding self-motion perception.},

  abstract = {Language serves as a cornerstone of human cognition. However, our knowledge about its neural basis is still a matter of debate, partly because ‘language’ is often ill-defined. Rather than equating language with ‘speech’ or ‘communication’, we propose that language is best described as a biologically determined computational cognitive mechanism that yields an unbounded array of hierarchically structured expressions. The results of recent brain imaging studies are consistent with this view of language as an autonomous cognitive mechanism, leading to a view of its neural organization, whereby language involves dynamic interactions of syntactic and semantic aspects represented in neural networks that connect the inferior frontal and superior temporal cortices functionally and structurally.},

  abstract = {This article describes a process theory based on active inference and belief propagation. Starting from the premise that all neuronal processing (and action selection) can be explained by maximizing Bayesian model evidence—or minimizing variational free energy—we ask whether neuronal responses can be described as a gradient descent on variational free energy. Using a standard (Markov decision process) generative model, we derive the neuronal dynamics implicit in this description and reproduce a remarkable range of well-characterized neuronal phenomena. These include repetition suppression, mismatch negativity, violation responses, place-cell activity, phase precession, theta sequences, theta-gamma coupling, evidence accumulation, race-to-bound dynamics, and transfer of dopamine responses. Furthermore, the (approximately Bayes’ optimal) behavior prescribed by these dynamics has a degree of face validity, providing a formal explanation for reward seeking, context learning, and epistemic foraging. Technically, the fact that a gradient descent appears to be a valid description of neuronal activity means that variational free energy is a Lyapunov function for neuronal dynamics, which therefore conform to Hamilton’s principle of least action.},

  abstract = {This article concerns the nature of evoked brain responses and the principles underlying their generation. We start with the premise that the sensory brain has evolved to represent or infer the causes of changes in its sensory inputs. The problem of inference is well formulated in statistical terms. The statistical fundaments of inference may therefore afford important constraints on neuronal implementation. By formulating the original ideas of Helmholtz on perception, in terms of modern-day statistical theories, one arrives at a model of perceptual inference and learning that can explain a remarkable range of neurobiological facts.                            It turns out that the problems of inferring the causes of sensory input (perceptual inference) and learning the relationship between input and cause (perceptual learning) can be resolved using exactly the same principle. Specifically, both inference and learning rest on minimizing the brain's free energy, as defined in statistical physics. Furthermore, inference and learning can proceed in a biologically plausible fashion. Cortical responses can be seen as the brain’s attempt to minimize the free energy induced by a stimulus and thereby encode the most likely cause of that stimulus. Similarly, learning emerges from changes in synaptic efficacy that minimize the free energy, averaged over all stimuli encountered. The underlying scheme rests on               empirical Bayes               and hierarchical models of how sensory input is caused. The use of hierarchical models enables the brain to construct prior expectations in a dynamic and context-sensitive fashion. This scheme provides a principled way to understand many aspects of cortical organization and responses. The aim of this article is to encompass many apparently unrelated anatomical, physiological and psychophysical attributes of the brain within a single theoretical perspective.                          In terms of cortical architectures, the theoretical treatment predicts that sensory cortex should be arranged hierarchically, that connections should be reciprocal and that forward and backward connections should show a functional asymmetry (forward connections are driving, whereas backward connections are both driving and modulatory). In terms of synaptic physiology, it predicts associative plasticity and, for dynamic models, spike-timing-dependent plasticity. In terms of electrophysiology, it accounts for classical and extra classical receptive field effects and long-latency or endogenous components of evoked cortical responses. It predicts the attenuation of responses encoding prediction error with perceptual learning and explains many phenomena such as repetition suppression, mismatch negativity (MMN) and the P300 in electroencephalography. In psychophysical terms, it accounts for the behavioural correlates of these physiological phenomena, for example, priming and global precedence. The final focus of this article is on perceptual learning as measured with the MMN and the implications for empirical studies of coupling among cortical areas using evoked sensory responses.},

  abstract = {Adding Artificial Associations                            In the mammalian cortex, there is significant spontaneous neural activity that is internally generated, rather than arising from sensory inputs, and this activity influences the processing of natural sensory stimuli. What role does this internally generated activity play in forming and accessing new memory representations? Using transgenic mice combined with controlled artificial activation of widely distributed neuronal ensembles associated with specific contexts,                                Garner                 et al.                              (p.               1513               ; see the Perspective by                                Morris and Takeuchi                              ) investigated how spontaneous neuronal activity is integrated into a given context representation. Animals underwent fear conditioning in two distinct contexts. When a circuit in one context was artificially activated during fear conditioning in a separate context, a so-called “hybrid” memory was formed. This artificially stimulated network became a necessary component of the memory trace. These results are consistent with the emerging view that internally generated brain activity is not noise, but a coherent representation that can be incorporated into new associations and memories.                        ,              The brains of transgenic mice incorporate experimentally generated neural activity into a memory trace.           ,                             We investigated the effect of activating a competing, artificially generated, neural representation on encoding of contextual fear memory in mice. We used a               c-fos               –based transgenic approach to introduce the hM               3               D               q               DREADD receptor (designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug) into neurons naturally activated by sensory experience. Neural activity could then be specifically and inducibly increased in the hM               3               D               q               -expressing neurons by an exogenous ligand. When an ensemble of neurons for one context (ctxA) was artificially activated during conditioning in a distinct second context (ctxB), mice formed a hybrid memory representation. Reactivation of the artificially stimulated network within the conditioning context was required for retrieval of the memory, and the memory was specific for the spatial pattern of neurons artificially activated during learning. Similar stimulation impaired recall when not part of the initial conditioning.},

  abstract = {Our visual system is fundamentally retinotopic. When viewing a stable scene, each eye movement shifts object features and locations on the retina. Thus, sensory representations must be updated, or remapped, across saccades to align pre- and post-saccadic inputs. The earliest remapping studies focused on anticipatory, pre-saccadic shifts of neuronal spatial receptive fields. Over time it has become clear that remapping can come in various flavors and may be mediated by multiple neural mechanisms. This review attempts to organize the various forms of remapping into a functional taxonomy based on experimental data and ongoing debates about forward vs. convergent remapping, pre- vs. post-saccadic remapping, and spatial vs. attentional remapping. We integrate findings from primate neurophysiological, human neuroimaging and behavioral, and computational modelling studies. We conclude by discussing persistent open questions related to remapping, with specific attention to binding of spatial and featural information during remapping and speculations about remapping’s functional significance.},

  abstract = {Trial by trial covariations between neural activity and perceptual decisions (quantified by choice Probability, CP) have been used to probe the contribution of sensory neurons to perceptual decisions. CPs are thought to be determined by both selective decoding of neural activity and by the structure of correlated noise among neurons, but the respective roles of these factors in creating CPs have been controversial. We used biologically-constrained simulations to explore this issue, taking advantage of a peculiar pattern of CPs exhibited by multisensory neurons in area MSTd that represent self-motion. Although models that relied on correlated noise or selective decoding could both account for the peculiar pattern of CPs, predictions of the selective decoding model were substantially more consistent with various features of the neural and behavioral data. While correlated noise is essential to observe CPs, our findings suggest that selective decoding of neuronal signals also plays important roles.           ,              Even the simplest tasks require the brain to process vast amounts of information. To take a step forward, for example, the brain must process information about the orientation of the animal's body and what the animal is seeing, hearing and feeling in order to determine whether any obstacles stand in the way. The brain must integrate all this information to make decisions about how to proceed. And once a decision is made, the brain must send signals via the nervous system to the muscles to physically move the foot forward.             Specialized brain cells called sensory neurons help to process this sensory information. For example, visual neurons process information about what the animal sees, while auditory neurons process information about what it hears. Other sensory neurons—called multisensory neurons—can process information coming from more than one of an animal's senses.             For more than two decades, researchers have known that the firing of an individual sensory neuron can be linked to the decision that an animal makes about the meaning of the sensory information it has received. The ability to predict whether an animal will make a given decision based on the firing of individual sensory neurons is often referred to as a ‘choice probability’. Measurements of single neurons have often been used to try to work out how the brain decodes the sensory information that is needed to carry out a specific task. However, it remains unclear whether choice probabilities really reflect how sensory information is decoded in the brain, or whether these measurements are just reflecting coordinated patterns of background ‘noise’ among the neurons as the decisions are being made.             Gu et al. set out to help resolve this debate by examining choice probabilities in the multisensory neurons in one area of the brain. A series of experiments was conducted to see how these neurons process information, both from the eyes and the part of the inner ear that helps control balance, to work out the direction in which an animal was moving. By performing computer simulations of the activity of groups of neurons, Gu et al. found that choice probability measurements are better explained by the models whereby these measurements did reflect the strategy that is used to decode the sensory information. Models based solely on patterns of correlated noise did not explain the data as well, though Gu et al. suggest that this noise is likely to also contribute to the observed effects.             Following on from the work of Gu et al., a major challenge will be to see if it is possible to infer how the brain extracts the relevant information from the different sensory neurons. This may require recordings from large groups of neurons, but it might help us to decipher how patterns of activity in the brain lead to decisions about the world around us.},

  abstract = {The present study provides the first electrophysiological evidence for dorsoventral variation in the receptive field properties of tectal cells in pigeons. According to their receptive field organization, visual response properties and laminar locations, 95 tectal neurons recorded in the present study could be categorized into two groups: (1) Fifty-five DL-neurons were recorded in the dorsal, dorso-lateral, lateral and ventro-lateral tectum and characterized by an excitatory receptive field surrounded by an inhibitory receptive field. Most of them almost equally responded to white and black objects, but did not respond to switch-on and -off of a light spot. (2) Forty VC-neurons were recorded in the ventral tectum and characterized by an excitatory receptive field alone. Their responses to switch-on of a light spot and to a white object were significantly stronger than those to light-off and to a black object, respectively. DL-neurons preferred higher velocity, whereas VC-neurons preferred lower velocity. The recording sites of 53 of 95 cells (56\%) examined were marked with pontamine sky blue, showing that DL-neurons were located in tectal layers I–IV, predominantly in layer II, whereas VC-neurons were mainly concentrated in sublayer IIc. The receptive fields of VC-neurons were located within the rostroventral visual field possibly corresponding to the red field of the pigeon retina, suggesting that they might be associated with visual food-foraging behaviors.},

  abstract = {A new theory is taking hold in neuroscience. It is the theory that the brain is essentially a hypothesis-testing mechanism, one that attempts to minimise the error of its predictions about the sensory input it receives from the world. It is an attractive theory because powerful theoretical arguments support it, and yet it is at heart stunningly simple. Jakob Hohwy explains and explores this theory from the perspective of cognitive science and philosophy. The key argument throughout The Predictive Mind is that the mechanism explains the rich, deep, and multifaceted character of our conscious perception. It also gives a unified account of how perception is sculpted by attention, and how it depends on action. The mind is revealed as having a fragile and indirect relation to the world. Though we are deeply in tune with the world we are also strangely distanced from it. The first part of the book sets out how the theory enables rich, layered perception. The theory's probabilistic and statistical foundations are explained using examples from empirical research and analogies to different forms of inference. The second part uses the simple mechanism in an explanation of problematic cases of how we manage to represent, and sometimes misrepresent, the world in health as well as in mental illness. The third part looks into the mind, and shows how the theory accounts for attention, conscious unity, introspection, self and the privacy of our mental world. -- Provided by publisher},

  abstract = {The search for the neural correlates of consciousness is in need of a systematic, principled foundation that can endow putative neural correlates with greater predictive and explanatory value. Here, we propose the predictive processing framework for brain function as a promising candidate for providing this systematic foundation. The proposal is motivated by that framework’s ability to address three general challenges to finding the neural correlates of consciousness, and to satisfy two constraints common to many theories of consciousness. Implementing the search for neural correlates of consciousness through the lens of predictive processing delivers strong potential for predictive and explanatory value through detailed, systematic mappings between neural substrates and phenomenological structure. We conclude that the predictive processing framework, precisely because it at the outset is not itself a theory of consciousness, has significant potential for advancing the neuroscience of consciousness.},

Primates have been shown to be able to navigate in virtual environments. For rodents, however, all previous attempts to develop VR systems in which rats behave in the same way as in corresponding 3-D environments have failed. The question arises as to whether, in principle, rodents can be trained to navigate in a properly designed virtual environment (VE), or whether this peculiarity is limited to primates and humans. We built a virtual reality set-up that takes the wide-angle visual system of rats into account. We show for the first time that rats learn spatial tasks in this VE quite readily. This set-up opens up new opportunities for investigations of information processing in navigation (e.g. the importance of optic flow or vestibular input).},

  abstract = {Early retinotopic cortex has traditionally been viewed as containing a veridical representation of the low-level properties of the image, not imbued by high-level interpretation and meaning. Yet several recent results indicate that neural representations in early retinotopic cortex reflect not just the sensory properties of the image, but also the perceived size and brightness of image regions. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging pattern analyses to ask whether the representation of an object in early retinotopic cortex changes when the object is recognized compared with when the same stimulus is presented but not recognized. Our data confirmed this hypothesis: the pattern of response in early retinotopic visual cortex to a two-tone “Mooney” image of an object was more similar to the response to the full grayscale photo version of the same image when observers knew what the two-tone image represented than when they did not. Further, in a second experiment, high-level interpretations actually overrode bottom-up stimulus information, such that the pattern of response in early retinotopic cortex to an identified two-tone image was more similar to the response to the photographic version of that stimulus than it was to the response to the identical two-tone image when it was not identified. Our findings are consistent with prior results indicating that perceived size and brightness affect representations in early retinotopic visual cortex and, further, show that even higher-level information—knowledge of object identity—also affects the representation of an object in early retinotopic cortex.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Emotional states influence bodily physiology, as exemplified in the top-down process by which anxiety causes faster beating of the heart               1–3               . However, whether an increased heart rate might itself induce anxiety or fear responses is unclear               3–8               . Physiological theories of emotion, proposed over a century ago, have considered that in general, there could be an important and even dominant flow of information from the body to the brain               9               . Here, to formally test this idea, we developed a noninvasive optogenetic pacemaker for precise, cell-type-specific control of cardiac rhythms of up to 900\,beats per minute in freely moving mice, enabled by a wearable micro-LED harness and the systemic viral delivery of a potent pump-like channelrhodopsin. We found that optically evoked tachycardia potently enhanced anxiety-like behaviour, but crucially only in risky contexts, indicating that both central (brain) and peripheral (body) processes may be involved in the development of emotional states. To identify potential mechanisms, we used whole-brain activity screening and electrophysiology to find brain regions that were~activated by imposed cardiac rhythms. We identified the posterior insular cortex as a potential mediator of bottom-up cardiac interoceptive processing, and found that optogenetic inhibition of this brain region attenuated the anxiety-like behaviour that was induced by optical cardiac pacing. Together, these findings reveal that cells of both the body and the brain must be considered together to understand the origins of emotional or affective states. More broadly, our results define a generalizable approach for noninvasive, temporally precise functional investigations of joint organism-wide interactions among targeted cells during behaviour.},

  abstract = {1. The striate cortex was studied in lightly anaesthetized macaque and spider monkeys by recording extracellularly from single units and stimulating the retinas with spots or patterns of light. Most cells can be categorized as simple, complex, or hypercomplex, with response properties very similar to those previously described in the cat. On the average, however, receptive fields are smaller, and there is a greater sensitivity to changes in stimulus orientation. A small proportion of the cells are colour coded. 2. Evidence is presented for at least two independent systems of columns extending vertically from surface to white matter. Columns of the first type contain cells with common receptive-field orientations. They are similar to the orientation columns described in the cat, but are probably smaller in cross-sectional area. In the second system cells are aggregated into columns according to eye preference. The ocular dominance columns are larger than the orientation columns, and the two sets of boundaries seem to be independent. 3. There is a tendency for cells to be grouped according to symmetry of responses to movement; in some regions the cells respond equally well to the two opposite directions of movement of a line, but other regions contain a mixture of cells favouring one direction and cells favouring the other. 4. A horizontal organization corresponding to the cortical layering can also be discerned. The upper layers (II and the upper two-thirds of III) contain complex and hypercomplex cells, but simple cells are virtually absent. The cells are mostly binocularly driven. Simple cells are found deep in layer III, and in IV A and IV B. In layer IV B they form a large proportion of the population, whereas complex cells are rare. In layers IV A and IV B one finds units lacking orientation specificity; it is not clear whether these are cell bodies or axons of geniculate cells. In layer IV most cells are driven by one eye only; this layer consists of a mosaic with cells of some regions responding to one eye only, those of other regions responding to the other eye. Layers V and VI contain mostly complex and hypercomplex cells, binocularly driven. 5. The cortex is seen as a system organized vertically and horizontally in entirely different ways. In the vertical system (in which cells lying along a vertical line in the cortex have common features) stimulus dimensions such as retinal position, line orientation, ocular dominance, and perhaps directionality of movement, are mapped in sets of superimposed but independent mosaics. The horizontal system segregates cells in layers by hierarchical orders, the lowest orders (simple cells monocularly driven) located in and near layer IV, the higher orders in the upper and lower layers.},

  abstract = {The ventral visual pathway is crucially involved in integrating low-level visual features into complex representations for objects and scenes. At an intermediate stage of the ventral visual pathway, V4 plays a crucial role in supporting this transformation. Many V4 neurons are selective for shape segments like curves and corners; however, it remains unclear whether these neurons are organized into clustered functional domains, a structural motif common across other visual cortices. Using two-photon calcium imaging in awake macaques, we confirmed and localized cortical domains selective for curves or corners in V4. Single-cell resolution imaging confirmed that curve- or corner-selective neurons were spatially clustered into such domains. When tested with hexagonal-segment stimuli, we find that stimulus smoothness is the cardinal difference between curve and corner selectivity in V4. Combining cortical population responses with single-neuron analysis, our results reveal that curves and corners are encoded by neurons clustered into functional domains in V4. This functionally specific population architecture bridges the gap between the early and late cortices of the ventral pathway and may serve to facilitate complex object recognition.},

  abstract = {Significance             Perceptually, the visual cortical areas are considered to reconstruct objects from the diverse components of early distributed processing by grouping image elements and segregating them from the background as a figure. An assumption here is that raw, essentially unchanged information from the visual thalamus provides the basic pattern essential for the operation of these higher-level abstractions. However, here we demonstrate strong enhancement of neuronal firing to the figure component of a figure-ground stimulus in recordings from the visual thalamus of behaving primates. This suggests the signature of a higher-order percept is introduced into the thalamus in a reentrant manner via the corticofugal feedback connections and causes our visual input to confirm what we think we are seeing.           ,              Figure-ground discrimination refers to the perception of an object, the figure, against a nondescript background. Neural mechanisms of figure-ground detection have been associated with feedback interactions between higher centers and primary visual cortex and have been held to index the effect of global analysis on local feature encoding. Here, in recordings from visual thalamus of alert primates, we demonstrate a robust enhancement of neuronal firing when the figure, as opposed to the ground, component of a motion-defined figure-ground stimulus is located over the receptive field. In this paradigm, visual stimulation of the receptive field and its near environs is identical across both conditions, suggesting the response enhancement reflects higher integrative mechanisms. It thus appears that cortical activity generating the higher-order percept of the figure is simultaneously reentered into the lowest level that is anatomically possible (the thalamus), so that the signature of the evolving representation of the figure is imprinted on the input driving it in an iterative process.},

  abstract = {We have explored the spatial organization of orientation contrast effects in primate V1. Our stimuli were either concentric patches of drifting grating of varying orientation and diameter or grating patches displaced in x–y coordinates around a central patch overlying the classical receptive field (CRF). All cells in the sample exhibited response suppression to iso-oriented stimuli exceeding the CRF. Changing the outer stimulus orientation revealed five response patterns: 1) orientation alignment suppression (17\% of cells)—a suppressive component tuned to the same orientation as the cell's optimal, 2) orientation contrast facilitation (63\%)—responses to orientation contrast stimuli exceeded those to the center stimulus alone, 3) nonorientation specific suppression (3\%), 4) mixed general suppression and alignment suppression (14\%), and 5) orientation contrast suppression (14\%)—cross-oriented stimuli evoked stronger suppression than iso-oriented stimuli. Thus most cells (94\%) showed larger responses to orientation contrast stimuli than to iso-oriented stimuli, and over one-half showed orientation contrast facilitation. There appeared to be a spatially structured organization of the zones driving the different response patterns with respect to the CRF. Nonorientation-specific suppression and orientation contrast suppression were predominantly evoked by orientation contrast borders located within the CRF, and orientation contrast facilitation was mainly driven by surround stimuli lying outside the CRF. This led to different response patterns according to border location. Zones driving orientation contrast facilitation were not necessarily contiguous to, nor uniformly distributed around, the CRF. Our data support two processes underlying orientation contrast enhancement effects: a simple variation in the strength of surround suppression drawing on the fact that surround suppression is tuned to the same orientation as the CRF and a second process driven by orientation contrast that enhanced cells' responses to CRF stimulation by either dis-inhibition or orientation contrast facilitation. We suggest these processes may serve to enhance response levels to salient image features such as junctions and corners and may contribute to orientation pop-out.},

  abstract = {We investigated the spatial organization of surround suppression in primate primary visual cortex (V1). We utilized drifting stimuli, configured to extend either from within the classical receptive field (CRF) to surrounding visual space, or from surrounding visual space into the CRF or subdivided to generate direction contrast, to make a detailed examination of the strength, spatial organization, direction dependence, mechanisms, and laminar distribution of surround suppression. Most cells (99/105, 94\%) through all cortical layers, exhibited suppression (mean reduction 67\%) to uniform stimuli exceeding the CRF, and 43\% exhibited a more than 70\% reduction. Testing with an annulus revealed two different patterns of surround influence. Some cells (37\% of cells), classical surround suppression (CSS) cells exhibited responses to an annulus encroaching on the CRF that were less than the plateau in the spatial summation curve. The majority (63\%), center-gated surround suppression (CGSS) cells, showed responses to annuli that equaled or exceeded the plateau in the spatial summation curve. Analysis suggested the CSS mechanism was implemented in all cells while the CGSS mechanism was implemented in varying strength across the sample with the extreme reflected in cells that gave larger responses to annuli than to a center stimulus. Reversing the direction of motion of the portion of the stimulus surrounding the CRF revealed four different patterns of effect: no reduction in the degree of suppression (22\% of cells), a reduction in surround suppression (41\%), a facilitation of the response above the level to the inner stimulus alone (37\%), and a facilitation of the response above that to the inner stimulus alone that also exceeded the values associated with an optimal inner stimulus. The facilitatory effects were only seen for reverse direction interfaces between the central and surrounding stimulus at diameters equal to or more than the CRF size. The zones driving the suppressive influences and the direction contrast facilitation were often spatially heterogeneous and for a number of cells bore strong comparison with the class of behavior reported for surround mechanisms in MT. This suggests a potential role, for example, in extracting information about motion contrast in the representation of the three dimensional structure of moving objects.},

  abstract = {Prediction errors are differences between expected and actual sensory input and are thought to be key computational signals that drive learning related plasticity. One way that prediction errors could drive learning is by activating neuromodulatory systems to gate plasticity. The catecholaminergic locus coeruleus (LC) is a major neuromodulatory system involved in neuronal plasticity in the cortex. Using two-photon calcium imaging in mice exploring a virtual environment, we found that the activity of LC axons in the cortex correlated with the magnitude of unsigned visuomotor prediction errors. LC response profiles were similar in both motor and visual cortical areas, indicating that LC axons broadcast prediction errors throughout the dorsal cortex. While imaging calcium activity in layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex, we found that optogenetic stimulation of LC axons facilitated learning of a stimulus-specific suppression of visual responses during locomotion. This plasticity – induced by minutes of LC stimulation – recapitulated the effect of visuomotor learning on a scale that is normally observed during visuomotor development across days. We conclude that prediction errors drive LC activity, and that LC activity facilitates sensorimotor plasticity in the cortex, consistent with a role in modulating learning rates.},

This approach may be applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history. Proton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as an entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that today’s NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) where we minimized the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetization were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.},

This chapter presents a framework for thinking about attention that facilitates the analysis of this cognitive process in terms of underlying neural mechanisms. Four processes are fundamental to attention: working memory, top-down sensitivity control, competitive selection, and automatic bottom-up filtering for salient stimuli. Each process makes a distinct and essential contribution to attention. Voluntary control of attention involves the first three processes (working memory, top-down sensitivity control, and competitive selection) operating in a recurrent loop. Recent results from neurobiological research on attention are discussed within this framework.},

  abstract = {Summary           Studies of perceptual decision-making have often assumed that the main role of sensory cortices is to provide sensory input to downstream processes that accumulate and drive behavioral decisions. We performed a systematic comparison of neural activity in primary visual (V1) to secondary visual and retrosplenial cortices, as mice performed a task where they should accumulate pulsatile visual cues through time to inform a navigational decision. Even in V1, only a small fraction of neurons had sensory-like responses to cues. Instead, in all areas neurons were sequentially active, and contained information ranging from sensory to cognitive, including cue timings, evidence, place/time, decision and reward outcome. Per-cue sensory responses were amplitude-modulated by various cognitive quantities, notably accumulated evidence.

Here we show that the content and strength of future voluntary imagery can be decoded from activity patterns in visual and frontal areas well before participants engage in voluntary imagery. Participants freely chose which of two images to imagine. Using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and multi-voxel pattern analysis, we decoded imagery content as far as 11\,seconds before the voluntary decision, in visual, frontal and subcortical areas. Decoding in visual areas in addition to perception-imagery generalization suggested that predictive patterns correspond to visual representations. Importantly, activity patterns in the primary visual cortex (V1) from before the decision, predicted future imagery vividness. Our results suggest that the contents and strength of mental imagery are influenced by sensory-like neural representations that emerge spontaneously before volition.},

  abstract = {Perceptual events derive their significance to an animal from their meaning about the world, that is from the information they carry about their causes. The brain should thus be able to efficiently infer the causes underlying our sensory events. Here we use multisensory cue combination to study causal inference in perception. We formulate an ideal-observer model that infers whether two sensory cues originate from the same location and that also estimates their location(s). This model accurately predicts the nonlinear integration of cues by human subjects in two auditory-visual localization tasks. The results show that indeed humans can efficiently infer the causal structure as well as the location of causes. By combining insights from the study of causal inference with the ideal-observer approach to sensory cue combination, we show that the capacity to infer causal structure is not limited to conscious, high-level cognition; it is also performed continually and effortlessly in perception.},

We administer classic false-belief tasks, widely used to test ToM in humans, to several language models, without any examples or pre-training. Our results show that models published before 2022 show virtually no ability to solve ToM tasks. Yet, the January 2022 version of GPT-3 (davinci-002) solved 70\% of ToM tasks, a performance comparable with that of seven-year-old children. Moreover, its November 2022 version (davinci-003), solved 93\% of ToM tasks, a performance comparable with that of nine-year-old children. These findings suggest that ToM-like ability (thus far considered to be uniquely human) may have spontaneously emerged as a byproduct of language models' improving language skills.},

  abstract = {Significance             The vestibular system provides a critical role to coordinate balance and movement, yet it remains an underappreciated sense. Functional MRI (fMRI) reveals much information about brain-wide sensory and cognitive processes. However, fMRI mapping of regions that actively process vestibular information remains technically challenging, as it can permit only limited movement during scanning. Here, we deploy fMRI and optogenetic stimulation of vestibular excitatory neurons to visualize numerous brain-wide central vestibular pathways and interrogate their functional roles in multisensory processing. Our study highlights multiple routes to investigate vestibular functions and their integration with other sensory systems. We reveal a method to gain critical knowledge into this critical brain system.           ,              Blood oxygen level-dependent functional MRI (fMRI) constitutes a powerful neuroimaging technology to map brain-wide functions in response to specific sensory or cognitive tasks. However, fMRI mapping of the vestibular system, which is pivotal for our sense of balance, poses significant challenges. Physical constraints limit a subject’s ability to perform motion- and balance-related tasks inside the scanner, and current stimulation techniques within the scanner are nonspecific to delineate complex vestibular nucleus (VN) pathways. Using fMRI, we examined brain-wide neural activity patterns elicited by optogenetically stimulating excitatory neurons of a major vestibular nucleus, the ipsilateral medial VN (MVN). We demonstrated robust optogenetically evoked fMRI activations bilaterally at sensorimotor cortices and their associated thalamic nuclei (auditory, visual, somatosensory, and motor), high-order cortices (cingulate, retrosplenial, temporal association, and parietal), and hippocampal formations (dentate gyrus, entorhinal cortex, and subiculum). We then examined the modulatory effects of the vestibular system on sensory processing using auditory and visual stimulation in combination with optogenetic excitation of the MVN. We found enhanced responses to sound in the auditory cortex, thalamus, and inferior colliculus ipsilateral to the stimulated MVN. In the visual pathway, we observed enhanced responses to visual stimuli in the ipsilateral visual cortex, thalamus, and contralateral superior colliculus. Taken together, our imaging findings reveal multiple brain-wide central vestibular pathways. We demonstrate large-scale modulatory effects of the vestibular system on sensory processing.},

In primates, neurons in extrastriate visual cortex (MSTd) are predominantly modulated by high-order optic flow patterns (e.g., spiral), yet a functional link to direct perception is lacking. Here, we applied electrical microstimulation to selectively manipulate population of MSTd neurons while macaques discriminated direction of rotation around line-of-sight (roll) or direction of linear-translation (heading), two tasks which were orthogonal in 3D spiral coordinate using a four-alternative-forced-choice paradigm. Microstimulation frequently biased animal’s roll perception towards coded labeled-lines of the artificial-stimulated neurons in either context with spiral or pure-rotation stimuli. Choice frequency was also altered between roll and translation flow-pattern. Our results provide direct causal-link evidence supporting that roll signals in MSTd, despite often mixed with translation signals, can be extracted by downstream areas for perception of rotation relative to gravity-vertical.},

  abstract = {Significance             Decision making involves the evaluation of the options, and the current popular theory puts the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in a central role in this process. However, by using a sophisticated task design in which the decision making requires both evidence accumulation over time and a stimulus-to-action transformation, we found that the OFC neuronal activity reflected neither. Both processes were instead represented in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and the stimulus-to-action transformation occurred before the evidence accumulation. Our study argued for a more limited role of the OFC in value-based decision making than previously proposed and indicated how the OFC and the DLPFC may work together to compute value during decision making.           ,              A key step of decision making is to determine the value associated with each option. The evaluation process often depends on the accumulation of evidence from multiple sources, which may arrive at different times. How evidence is accumulated for value computation in the brain during decision making has not been well studied. To address this problem, we trained rhesus monkeys to perform a decision-making task in which they had to make eye movement choices between two targets, whose reward probabilities had to be determined with the combined evidence from four sequentially presented visual stimuli. We studied the encoding of the reward probabilities associated with the stimuli and the eye movements in the orbitofrontal (OFC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) cortices during the decision process. We found that the OFC neurons encoded the reward probability associated with individual pieces of evidence in the stimulus domain. Importantly, the representation of the reward probability in the OFC was transient, and the OFC did not encode the reward probability associated with the combined evidence from multiple stimuli. The computation of the combined reward probabilities was observed only in the DLPFC and only in the action domain. Furthermore, the reward probability encoding in the DLPFC exhibited an asymmetric pattern of mixed selectivity that supported the computation of the stimulus-to-action transition of reward information. Our results reveal that the OFC and the DLPFC play distinct roles in the value computation during evidence accumulation.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encodes expected outcomes and plays a critical role in flexible, outcome-guided behavior. The OFC projects to primary visual cortex (V1), yet the function of this top-down projection is unclear. We find that optogenetic activation of OFC projection to V1 reduces the amplitude of V1 visual responses via the recruitment of local somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons. Using mice performing a Go/No-Go visual task, we show that the OFC projection to V1 mediates the outcome-expectancy modulation of V1 responses to the reward-irrelevant No-Go stimulus. Furthermore, V1-projecting OFC neurons reduce firing during expectation of reward. In addition, chronic optogenetic inactivation of OFC projection to V1 impairs, whereas chronic activation of SST interneurons in V1 improves the learning of Go/No-Go visual task, without affecting the immediate performance. Thus, OFC top-down projection to V1 is crucial to drive visual associative learning by modulating the response gain of V1 neurons to non-relevant stimulus.},

Although numerous studies have indicated posterior cingulate areas are involved in spatial tasks, it is unclear how their neurons represent self-motion signals. Providing translation and rotation stimuli to macaques on a 6-degree-of-freedom motion platform, we discovered robust vestibular responses in PCC. A combined three-dimensional spatiotemporal model captured data well and revealed multiple temporal components including velocity, acceleration, jerk, and position. Compared to PCC, RSC contained moderate vestibular temporal modulations and lacked significant spatial tuning. Visual self-motion signals were much weaker in both regions compared to the vestibular signals. We conclude that macaque posterior cingulate region carries vestibular-dominant self-motion signals with plentiful temporal components that could be useful for path integration.},

We used event-related fMRI to study dynamic changes in brain activity during both early and prolonged exposure to visual prisms. Participants performed a pointing task before, during, and after prism exposure. Measures of trial-by-trial pointing errors and corrections allowed parametric analyses of brain activity as a function of performance. We show that during the earliest phase of prism exposure, anterior intraparietal sulcus was primarily implicated in error detection, whereas parieto-occipital sulcus was implicated in error correction. Cerebellum activity showed progressive increases during prism exposure, in accordance with a key role for spatial realignment. This time course further suggests that the cerebellum might promote neural changes in superior temporal cortex, which was selectively activated during the later phase of prism exposure and could mediate the effects of prism adaptation on cognitive spatial representations.},

Two forms of illusory motion are seen: [i] a motion “racing” along the diagonal interface between the strips and [ii] lateral (sideways) motion of the strip sections. We found the relative salience of these two illusory motions to be strongly influenced by the vertical spacing and length of the line gratings, and the period length of the zigzag strips. Both illusory motions are abolished when the abutting strips are interleaved, separated by a gap or when a real line is superimposed at the interface. Illusory motion is also severely weakened when equiluminant colored grating lines are used. Illusory motion perception is fully restored at \&lt; 20\% luminance contrast. Using adaptation, we find that line-ends alone are insufficient for illusory motion perception, and that both physical carrier motion and line orientation are required. We finally test a classical spatiotemporal energy model of V1 cells that exhibit direction tuning changes that are consistent with the direction of illusory motion. Taking this data together, we constructed a new visual illusion and surmise its origin to interactions of spatial and temporal energy of the lines and line-ends preferentially driving the magnocellular pathway.},

  abstract = {Recent psychophysical experiments indicate that humans perform near-optimal Bayesian inference in a wide variety of tasks, ranging from cue integration to decision making to motor control. This implies that neurons both represent probability distributions and combine those distributions according to a close approximation to Bayes' rule. At first sight, it would seem that the high variability in the responses of cortical neurons would make it difficult to implement such optimal statistical inference in cortical circuits. We argue that, in fact, this variability implies that populations of neurons automatically represent probability distributions over the stimulus, a type of code we call probabilistic population codes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Poisson-like variability observed in cortex reduces a broad class of Bayesian inference to simple linear combinations of populations of neural activity. These results hold for arbitrary probability distributions over the stimulus, for tuning curves of arbitrary shape and for realistic neuronal variability.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The hippocampus has been extensively implicated in spatial navigation in rodents and more recently in bats. Numerous studies have revealed that various kinds of spatial information are encoded across hippocampal regions. In contrast, investigations of spatial behavioral correlates in the primate hippocampus are scarce and have been mostly limited to head-restrained subjects during virtual navigation. However, recent advances made in freely-moving primates suggest marked differences in spatial representations from rodents, albeit some similarities. Here, we review empirical studies examining the neural correlates of spatial navigation in the primate (including human) hippocampus at the levels of local field potentials and single units. The lower frequency theta oscillations are often intermittent. Single neuron responses are highly mixed and task-dependent. We also discuss neuronal selectivity in the eye and head coordinates. Finally, we propose that future studies should focus on investigating both intrinsic and extrinsic population activity and examining spatial coding properties in large-scale hippocampal-neocortical networks across tasks.},

  abstract = {Neuroscience has focused on the detailed implementation of computation, studying neural codes, dynamics and circuits. In machine learning, however, artificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) the cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. In support of these hypotheses, we argue that a range of implementations of credit assignment through multiple layers of neurons are compatible with our current knowledge of neural circuitry, and that the brain's specialized systems can be interpreted as enabling efficient optimization for specific problem classes. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by which neuroscience could seek to refine and test these hypotheses.},

  abstract = {CO2 injection technology into coal seams to enhance CH4 recovery (CO2-ECBM), therefore presenting the dual benefit of greenhouse gas emission reduction and clean fossil energy development. In order to gaze into the features of CO2 injection’s influence on reservoir pressure and permeability, the Thermal-Hydraulic-Mechanical coupling mechanism of CO2 injection into the coal seam is considered for investigation. The competitive adsorption, diffusion, and seepage flowing of CO2 and CH4 as well as the dynamic evolution of fracture porosity of coal seams are considered. Fluid physical parameters are obtained by the fitting equation using MATLAB to call EOS software Refprop. Based on the Canadian CO2-ECBM project CSEMP, the numerical simulation targeting shallow low-rank coal is carried out, and the finite element method is used in the software COMSOL Multiphysics. Firstly, the direct recovery (CBM) and CO2-ECBM are compared, and it is confirmed that the injection of CO2 has a significant improvement effect on methane production. Secondly, the influence of injection pressure and temperature is discussed. Increasing the injection pressure can increase the pressure difference in the reservoir in a short time, so as to improve the CH4 production and CO2 storage. However, the increase in gas injection pressure will also lead to the rapid attenuation of near-well reservoir permeability, resulting in the weakening of injection capacity. Also, when the injection temperature increases, the CO2 concentration is relatively reduced, and the replacement effect on CH4 is weakened, resulting in a slight decrease in CBM production and CO2 storage.},

  abstract = {Neuropsychological data in humans demonstrated a pivotal role of the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampal formation (HF) and the parahippocampal gyrus (PH), in allocentric (environment-centered) spatial learning and memory. In the present study, the functional significance of the monkey HF and PH neurons in allocentric spatial processing was analyzed during performance of the spatial tasks. In the tasks, the monkey either freely moved to one of four reward areas in the experimental field by driving a cab that the monkey rode (real translocation task) or freely moved a pointer to one of four reward areas on the monitor (virtual translocation task) by manipulating a joystick. Of 389 neurons recorded from the monkey HF and PH, 166 had place fields that displayed increased activity in a specific area in the experimental field and/or on the monitor (location-differential neurons). More HF and PH neurons responded in the real translocation task. These neurons had low mean spontaneous firing rates (0.96 spikes/sec), similar to those of rodent HF place cells. The remaining nonresponsive neurons had significantly higher mean firing rates (8.39 spikes/sec), similar to interneurons or θ cells in the rodent HF. Furthermore, most location-differential neurons showed different responses in different tasks. These results suggest that the HF and PH are crucial in allocentric information processing and, moreover, that the HF can encode different reference frames that are context or task-dependent. This may be the neural basis of episodic memory.},

He carried out brilliant work in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, laying the foundation for the kinetic theory of gases. This book, published originally in 1871, summarises his work in this field. It includes the 'Maxwell relations' that still feature in every standard text on thermodynamics. It also outlines his famous thought experiment, later named Maxwell's 'demon'. This idea, which appeared to contradict the second law of thermodynamics, would inspire scientific debate well into the twentieth century.

The theory is closely related to the Bayesian brain framework and, over the last two decades, has gained substantial influence in the fields of theoretical and cognitive neuroscience. A large body of research has arisen based on both empirically testing improved and extended theoretical and mathematical models of predictive coding, as well as in evaluating their potential biological plausibility for implementation in the brain and the concrete neurophysiological and psychological predictions made by the theory. Despite this enduring popularity, however, no comprehensive review of predictive coding theory, and especially of recent developments in this field, exists. Here, we provide a comprehensive review both of the core mathematical structure and logic of predictive coding, thus complementing recent tutorials in the literature. We also review a wide range of classic and recent work within the framework, ranging from the neurobiologically realistic microcircuits that could implement predictive coding, to the close relationship between predictive coding and the widely-used backpropagation of error algorithm, as well as surveying the close relationships between predictive coding and modern machine learning techniques.},

  abstract = {The central nervous system is lined by meninges, classically known as dura, arachnoid, and pia mater. We show the existence of a fourth meningeal layer that compartmentalizes the subarachnoid space in the mouse and human brain, designated the subarachnoid lymphatic-like membrane (SLYM). SLYM is morpho- and immunophenotypically similar to the mesothelial membrane lining of peripheral organs and body cavities, and it encases blood vessels and harbors immune cells. Functionally, the close apposition of SLYM with the endothelial lining of the meningeal venous sinus permits direct exchange of small solutes between cerebrospinal fluid and venous blood, thus representing the mouse equivalent of the arachnoid granulations. The functional characterization of SLYM provides fundamental insights into brain immune barriers and fluid transport.           ,              An extra layer lines the brain                            The traditional view is that the brain is surrounded by three layers, the dura, arachnoid, and pia mater. Møllgård               et al               . found a fourth meningeal layer called the subarachnoid lymphatic-like membrane (SLYM). SLYM is immunophenotypically distinct from the other meningeal layers in the human and mouse brain and represents a tight barrier for solutes of more than 3 kilodaltons, effectively subdividing the subarachnoid space into two different compartments. SLYM is the host for a large population of myeloid cells, the number of which increases in response to inflammation and aging, so this layer represents an innate immune niche ideally positioned to surveil the cerebrospinal fluid. —SMH                        ,              A fourth meningeal layer acts as a barrier that divides the subarachnoid space into two distinct compartments.},

Previous analyses of this problem have compared the performance of human or animal observers in detection or discrimination tasks with the signals carried by individual neurons, but have been hampered because neuronal and perceptual data were not obtained at the same time and under the same conditions1–4. We have now measured the performance of monkeys and of visual cortical neurons while the animals performed a psychophysical task well matched to the properties of the neurons under study. Here we report that the reliability and sensitivity of most neurons on this task equalled or exceeded that of the monkeys. We therefore suggest that under our conditions, psychophysical judgements could be based on the activity of a relatively small number of neurons.},

Here we studied the selectivity of neurons in visual area V4 of macaque monkey with synthetic textures having known combinations of higher-order image statistics. We found that V4 neurons typically respond best to particular sparse combinations of these statistics. We also found that population responses of texture-selective V4 neurons can explain human texture discrimination and categorization. Because the statistics of each image can be computed from responses of upstream neurons in visual area V1, our results provide a clear account of how the visual system processes local image features to create the global perception of texture in natural images.           ,              Our daily visual experiences are inevitably linked to recognizing the rich variety of textures. However, how the brain encodes and differentiates a plethora of natural textures remains poorly understood. Here, we show that many neurons in macaque V4 selectively encode sparse combinations of higher-order image statistics to represent natural textures. We systematically explored neural selectivity in a high-dimensional texture space by combining texture synthesis and efficient-sampling techniques. This yielded parameterized models for individual texture-selective neurons. The models provided parsimonious but powerful predictors for each neuron’s preferred textures using a sparse combination of image statistics. As a whole population, the neuronal tuning was distributed in a way suitable for categorizing textures and quantitatively predicts human ability to discriminate textures. Together, we suggest that the collective representation of visual image statistics in V4 plays a key role in organizing the natural texture perception.},

  abstract = {Neural mechanisms of perceptual decision making have been extensively studied in experimental settings that mimic stable environments with repeating stimuli, fixed rules, and payoffs. In contrast, we live in an ever-changing environment and have varying goals and behavioral demands. To accommodate variability, our brain flexibly adjusts decision-making processes depending on context. Here, we review a growing body of research that explores the neural mechanisms underlying this flexibility. We highlight diverse forms of context dependency in decision making implemented through a variety of neural computations. Context-dependent neural activity is observed in a distributed network of brain structures, including posterior parietal, sensory, motor, and subcortical regions, as well as the prefrontal areas classically implicated in cognitive control. We propose that investigating the distributed network underlying flexible decisions is key to advancing our understanding and discuss a path forward for experimental and theoretical investigations.},

Psychophysical reverse correlation is commonly used to quantify how fluctuations of sensory stimuli influence behavior and is generally believed to uncover the spatiotemporal weighting functions of sensory processes. Here we show that reverse correlations also reflect decision-making processes and can deviate significantly from the true sensory filters. Specifically, changes of decision bound and mechanisms of evidence integration systematically alter psychophysical reverse correlations. Similarly, trial-to-trial variability of sensory and motor delays and decision times causes systematic distortions in psychophysical kernels that should not be attributed to sensory mechanisms. We show that ignoring details of the decision-making process results in misinterpretation of reverse correlations, but proper use of these details turns reverse correlation into a powerful method for studying both sensory and decision-making mechanisms.},

Xenopus               accurately orients toward the source of the stimulus when the stimulus is generated several cm away from its body. However, although               Xenopus               orientation behavior fluctuates when the stimulus is generated very near or above its body, the amplitude of the body rotation in the orienting behavior was affected by the preceding orienting behavior that had been performed several seconds before. In particular, the amplitude of the rotation in response to the stimulus applied above the body was positively correlated with that of the preceding rotation behavior in response to a stimulus generated several cm away from the body, indicating that               Xenopus               tends to repeat the preceding behavior if the direction of the stimulus is ambiguous. The results presented show the evidence that               Xenopus               can retain the amplitude of the rotation of the preceding orienting behavior for several seconds.},

  abstract = {Many current neurophysiological, psychophysical, and psychological approaches to vision rest on the idea that when we see, the brain produces an internal representation of the world. The activation of this internal representation is assumed to give rise to the experience of seeing. The problem with this kind of approach is that it leaves unexplained how the existence of such a detailed internal representation might produce visual consciousness. An alternative proposal is made here. We propose that seeing is a way of acting. It is a particular way of exploring the environment. Activity in internal representations does not generate the experience of seeing. The outside world serves as its own, external, representation. The experience of seeing occurs when the organism masters what we call the governing laws of sensorimotor contingency. The advantage of this approach is that it provides a natural and principled way of accounting for visual consciousness, and for the differences in the perceived quality of sensory experience in the different sensory modalities. Several lines of empirical evidence are brought forward in support of the theory, in particular: evidence from experiments in sensorimotor adaptation, visual “filling in,” visual stability despite eye movements, change blindness, sensory substitution, and color perception.},

To do so, it needs to detect correlation, lag and synchrony across the senses; optimally integrate related information; and dynamically adapt to spatiotemporal conflicts across the senses. Here we show that all these aspects of multisensory perception can be jointly explained by postulating an elementary processing unit akin to the Hassenstein–Reichardt detector—a model originally developed for visual motion perception. This unit, termed the multisensory correlation detector (MCD), integrates related multisensory signals through a set of temporal filters followed by linear combination. Our model can tightly replicate human perception as measured in a series of empirical studies, both novel and previously published. MCDs provide a unified general theory of multisensory processing, which simultaneously explains a wide spectrum of phenomena with a simple, yet physiologically plausible model.},

To address this, we performed single-unit electrophysiology in V1 of freely moving mice while simultaneously measuring the mouse’s eye position, head orientation, and the visual scene from the mouse’s perspective. From these measures, we mapped spatiotemporal receptive fields during free movement based on the gaze-corrected visual input. Furthermore, we found a significant fraction of neurons tuned for eye and head position, and these signals were integrated with visual responses through a multiplicative mechanism in the majority of modulated neurons. These results provide new insight into coding in the mouse V1 and, more generally, provide a paradigm for investigating visual physiology under natural conditions, including active sensing and ethological behavior.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Active inference is an approach to understanding behaviour that rests upon the idea that the brain uses an internal generative model to predict incoming sensory data. The fit between this model and data may be improved in two ways. The brain could optimise probabilistic beliefs about the variables in the generative model (i.e. perceptual inference). Alternatively, by acting on the world, it could change the sensory data, such that they are more consistent with the model. This implies a common objective function (variational free energy) for action and perception that scores the fit between an internal model and the world. We compare two free energy functionals for active inference in the framework of Markov decision processes. One of these is a functional of beliefs (i.e. probability distributions) about states and policies, but a function of observations, while the second is a functional of beliefs about all three. In the former (               expected               free energy), prior beliefs about outcomes are not part of the generative model (because they are absorbed into the prior over policies). Conversely, in the second (               generalised               free energy), priors over outcomes become an explicit component of the generative model. When using the free energy function, which is blind to future observations, we equip the generative model with a prior over policies that ensure preferred (i.e. priors over) outcomes are realised. In other words, if we expect to encounter a particular kind of outcome, this lends plausibility to those policies for which this outcome is a consequence. In addition, this formulation ensures that selected policies minimise uncertainty about future outcomes by minimising the free energy expected in the future. When using the free energy functional—that effectively treats future observations as hidden states—we show that policies are inferred or selected that realise prior preferences by minimising the free energy of future expectations. Interestingly, the form of posterior beliefs about policies (and associated belief updating) turns out to be identical under both formulations, but the quantities used to compute them are not.},

It has not been tested whether dopamine (DA) is sufficient to trigger this process. Here we use optogenetic self-stimulation of DA neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to selectively mimic the defining commonality of addictive drugs. All mice readily acquired self-stimulation. After weeks of abstinence, cue-induced relapse was observed in parallel with a potentiation of excitatory afferents onto D1 receptor-expressing neurons of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). When the mice had to endure a mild electric foot shock to obtain a stimulation, some stopped while others persevered. The resistance to punishment was associated with enhanced neural activity in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) while chemogenetic inhibition of the OFC reduced compulsivity. Together, these results show that stimulating VTA DA neurons induces behavioral and cellular hallmarks of addiction, indicating sufficiency for the induction and progression of the disease.},

Early visual cortex can code for high-level auditory information, with neural patterns representing natural sound stimulation (Vetter               et al.               2014               Curr.

What is the adaptive function of bimodal representations in visual cortex? What type of information projects from auditory to visual cortex? What are the anatomical constraints of auditory information in V1, for example, periphery versus fovea, superficial versus deep cortical layers? Is there a putative neural mechanism we can infer from human neuroimaging data and recent theoretical accounts of cortex? We also present data showing we can read out high-level auditory information from the activation patterns of early visual cortex even when visual cortex receives simple visual stimulation, suggesting independent channels for visual and auditory signals in V1. We speculate which cellular mechanisms allow V1 to be contextually modulated by auditory input to facilitate perception, cognition and behaviour. Beyond cortical feedback that facilitates perception, we argue that there is also feedback serving counterfactual processing during imagery, dreaming and mind wandering, which is not relevant for immediate perception but for behaviour and cognition over a longer time frame.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce a system to control and maintain an olfactory virtual landscape. This system uses rapid flow controllers and an online predictive algorithm to deliver precise odorant distributions to head-fixed mice as they explore a virtual environment. We establish an odor-guided virtual navigation behavior that engages hippocampal CA1 “place cells” that exhibit similar properties to those previously reported for real and visual virtual environments, demonstrating that navigation based on different sensory modalities recruits a similar cognitive map. This method opens new possibilities for studying the neural mechanisms of olfactory-driven behaviors, multisensory integration, innate valence, and low-dimensional sensory-spatial processing.},

  abstract = {Systems neuroscience seeks explanations for how the brain implements a wide variety of perceptual, cognitive and motor tasks. Conversely, artificial intelligence attempts to design computational systems based on the tasks they will have to solve. In artificial neural networks, the three components specified by design are the objective functions, the learning rules and the architectures. With the growing success of deep learning, which utilizes brain-inspired architectures, these three designed components have increasingly become central to how we model, engineer and optimize complex artificial learning systems. Here we argue that a greater focus on these components would also benefit systems neuroscience. We give examples of how this optimization-based framework can drive theoretical and experimental progress in neuroscience. We contend that this principled perspective on systems neuroscience will help to generate more rapid progress.},

  abstract = {Most studies of spinal interneurons in vertebrate motor circuits have focused on the activity of interneurons in a single motor behavior. As a result, relatively little is known about the extent to which particular classes of spinal interneurons participate in different behaviors. Similarities between the morphology and connections of interneurons activated in swimming and escape movements in different fish and amphibians led to the hypothesis that spinal interneurons might be shared by these behaviors. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of the optical transparency of zebrafish larvae and developed a new preparation in which we could use confocal calcium imaging to monitor the activity of individual identified interneurons noninvasively, while we simultaneously filmed the movements of the fish with a high-speed digital camera. With this approach, we could directly examine the involvement of individual interneurons in different motor behaviors. Our work revealed unexpected differences in the interneurons activated in swimming and escape behaviors. The observations lead to predictions of different behavioral roles for particular classes of spinal interneurons that can eventually be tested directly in zebrafish by using laser ablations or mutant lines with interneuronal deficits.},

  abstract = {Significance             Dysregulation of emotion is central to the etiology of mood disorders, such as depression. A causal understanding of how neural structures regulate emotion and arousal could help to improve treatments for these psychiatric disorders. Studies of patients with depression indicate that a particular part of the frontal lobe, the subgenual cingulate cortex, plays an important role in affective processing, though its precise contribution remains unclear. Here we show that, in macaque monkeys, this small part of the frontal cortex is necessary for sustaining elevated arousal in anticipation of positive emotional events. This finding suggests a mechanism for the contribution of this area to affective regulation, including an account for the lack of pleasure and passivity that characterizes mood disorders.           ,              The subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (subgenual ACC) plays an important role in regulating emotion, and degeneration in this area correlates with depressed mood and anhedonia. Despite this understanding, it remains unknown how this part of the prefrontal cortex causally contributes to emotion, especially positive emotions. Using Pavlovian conditioning procedures in macaque monkeys, we examined the contribution of the subgenual ACC to autonomic arousal associated with positive emotional events. After such conditioning, autonomic arousal increases in response to cues that predict rewards, and monkeys maintain this heightened state of arousal during an interval before reward delivery. Here we show that although monkeys with lesions of the subgenual ACC show the initial, cue-evoked arousal, they fail to sustain a high level of arousal until the anticipated reward is delivered. Control procedures showed that this impairment did not result from differences in autonomic responses to reward delivery alone, an inability to learn the association between cues and rewards, or to alterations in the light reflex. Our data indicate that the subgenual ACC may contribute to positive affect by sustaining arousal in anticipation of positive emotional events. A failure to maintain positive affect for expected pleasurable events could provide insight into the pathophysiology of psychological disorders in which negative emotions dominate a patient’s affective experience.},

  abstract = {For machine agents to successfully interact with humans in real-world settings, they will need to develop an understanding of human mental life. Intuitive psychology, the ability to reason about hidden mental variables that drive observable actions, comes naturally to people: even pre-verbal infants can tell agents from objects, expecting agents to act efficiently to achieve goals given constraints. Despite recent interest in machine agents that reason about other agents, it is not clear if such agents learn or hold the core psychology principles that drive human reasoning. Inspired by cognitive development studies on intuitive psychology, we present a benchmark consisting of a large dataset of procedurally generated 3D animations, AGENT (Action, Goal, Efficiency, coNstraint, uTility), structured around four scenarios (goal preferences, action efficiency, unobserved constraints, and cost-reward trade-offs) that probe key concepts of core intuitive psychology. We validate AGENT with human-ratings, propose an evaluation protocol emphasizing generalization, and compare two strong baselines built on Bayesian inverse planning and a Theory of Mind neural network. Our results suggest that to pass the designed tests of core intuitive psychology at human levels, a model must acquire or have built-in representations of how agents plan, combining utility computations and core knowledge of objects and physics.},

  abstract = {Having information from multiple senses converge onto the same neurons allows the neurons to work in concert so that their combined product can enhance the physiological salience of an event, increase the ability to render a judgment about its identity, and initiate responses faster than would otherwise be possible.This interactive synergy among the senses, or 'multisensory integration', is manifested in individual neurons, by enhancing or degrading their responses, and in behaviour, by producing corresponding alterations in performance.Multisensory integration is guided by principles that relate to the spatial and temporal relationship among cross-modal stimuli, as well as to the vigor of the neuron's responses to their individual component stimuli.The spatial principle of multisensory integration relies on faithful register among a neuron's different receptive fields and this register must be maintained in spite of independent movement of the sense organs (such as the eyes). Recent studies suggest that compensation for such movement is less than perfect, and occurs to varying degrees in different neurons and brain regions. Degradation in receptive-field register has strong implications for multisensory integration, but these remain to be examined empirically.Multisensory integration is crucial for high-level cognitive functions in which considerations such as semantic congruence might determine its neural products and the perceptions and behaviours that depend on them.Multiple approaches have demonstrated the impact of multisensory integration in different brain structures in different species, including single-neuron and event-related-potential recordings and brain-imaging techniques.Primary, sensory-specific areas of the brain have now been shown to receive inputs from other senses. The functional role of these other inputs is not yet known, but they might facilitate the processing of information in the native sense.},

  abstract = {Interfacing electronics with neural tissue is crucial for understanding complex biological functions, but conventional bioelectronics consist of rigid electrodes fundamentally incompatible with living systems. The difference between static solid-state electronics and dynamic biological matter makes seamless integration of the two challenging. To address this incompatibility, we developed a method to dynamically create soft substrate-free conducting materials within the biological environment. We demonstrate in vivo electrode formation in zebrafish and leech models, using endogenous metabolites to trigger enzymatic polymerization of organic precursors within an injectable gel, thereby forming conducting polymer gels with long-range conductivity. This approach can be used to target specific biological substructures and is suitable for nerve stimulation, paving the way for fully integrated, in vivo–fabricated electronics within the nervous system.           ,              A recipe for in situ bioelectronic materials                            There are challenges in making materials that are soft enough to be interfaced with living tissue but firm enough to be inserted into the body. Strakosas               et al               . bypassed this challenge by developing a route to the polymer in vivo (see the Perspective by Inal). They introduced a complex precursor system including an oxidase to generate hydrogen peroxide in situ, a peroxidase to catalyze oxidative polymerization, a water-soluble conjugated monomer, a polyelectrolyte with counterions for covalent cross linking, and a surfactant for stabilization. With this cocktail, the authors were able to induce polymerization and subsequent gelation in different tissue environments. Demonstrations include the ex situ fabrication of this conducting gel in zebrafish (brain, fin, and heart), in food samples (beef, pork, chicken, and tofu), and a proof of concept of in vivo stimulation of a leech nerve. —MSL                        ,              A method was developed for metabolite-induced in vivo fabrication of substrate-free organic bioelectronics.},

  abstract = {Neuron activity across the brain                            How is it that groups of neurons dispersed through the brain interact to generate complex behaviors? Three papers in this issue present brain-scale studies of neuronal activity and dynamics (see the Perspective by Huk and Hart). Allen               et al.               found that in thirsty mice, there is widespread neural activity related to stimuli that elicit licking and drinking. Individual neurons encoded task-specific responses, but every brain area contained neurons with different types of response. Optogenetic stimulation of thirst-sensing neurons in one area of the brain reinstated drinking and neuronal activity across the brain that previously signaled thirst. Gründemann               et al.               investigated the activity of mouse basal amygdala neurons in relation to behavior during different tasks. Two ensembles of neurons showed orthogonal activity during exploratory and nonexploratory behaviors, possibly reflecting different levels of anxiety experienced in these areas. Stringer               et al.               analyzed spontaneous neuronal firing, finding that neurons in the primary visual cortex encoded both visual information and motor activity related to facial movements. The variability of neuronal responses to visual stimuli in the primary visual area is mainly related to arousal and reflects the encoding of latent behavioral states.

Ongoing activity exists even in primary sensory cortices and has been hypothesized to reflect recapitulation of previous sensory experiences, or expectations of possible sensory events. Alternatively, ongoing activity could be related to behavioral and cognitive states.                                         RATIONALE               Much previous work has linked spontaneous neural activity to behavior through one-dimensional measures like running speed and pupil diameter. However, mice perform diverse behaviors consisting of whisking, licking, sniffing, and other facial movements. We hypothesized that there exists a multidimensional representation of behavior in visual cortex and that previously reported “noise” during stimulus presentations may in fact be behaviorally driven. To investigate this, we recorded the activity of \textasciitilde 10,000 neurons in visual cortex of awake mice using two-photon calcium imaging, while simultaneously monitoring the facial movements using an infrared camera. In a second set of experiments, we recorded the activity of thousands of neurons across the brain using eight simultaneous Neuropixels probes, again videographically monitoring facial behavior.                                         RESULTS               First, we found that ongoing activity in visual cortex is high dimensional: More than a hundred latent dimensions could be reliably extracted from the population activity. We found that a third of this activity could be predicted by a multidimensional model of the mouse’s behavior, extracted from the face video. This behaviorally related activity was not limited to visual cortex. We observed multidimensional representations of behavior in electrophysiological recordings from frontal, sensorimotor, and retrosplenial cortex; hippocampus; striatum; thalamus; and midbrain. Even though both behavior and neural activity contained fast–time scale fluctuations on the order of 200 ms, they were only related to each other at a time scale of about 1 s. We next investigated how this spontaneous, behavior-related signal interacts with stimulus responses. The representation of sensory stimuli and behavioral variables was mixed in the same neurons: The fractions of each neuron’s variance explained by stimuli and by behavior were only slightly negatively correlated, and neurons with similar stimulus responses did not have more similar behavioral correlates. Nevertheless, at a population level, the neural dimensions encoding motor variables overlapped with those encoding visual stimuli along only one dimension, which coherently increased or decreased the activity of the entire population. Activity in all other behaviorally driven dimensions continued unperturbed regardless of sensory stimulation.                                         CONCLUSION               The brainwide representation of behavioral variables suggests that information encoded nearly anywhere in the forebrain is combined with behavioral state variables into a mixed representation. We found that these multidimensional signals are present both during ongoing activity and during passive viewing of a stimulus. This suggests that previously reported noise during stimulus presentations may consist primarily of behavioral-state information. What benefit could this ubiquitous mixing of sensory and motor information provide? The most appropriate behavior for an animal to perform at any moment depends on the combination of available sensory data, ongoing motor actions, and purely internal variables such as motivational drives. Integration of sensory inputs with motor actions must therefore occur somewhere in the nervous system. Our data indicate that it happens as early as primary sensory cortex.                                                   Large-scale neural population recordings can be predicted from behavior.                                        We used new recording technologies to simultaneously monitor the activity of \textasciitilde 10,000 neurons in a single brain area and \textasciitilde 3000 neurons from across the brain (top left). These neurons showed slow–time scale patterns of coactivation restricted to subsets of neurons which were distributed across the brain (top right). The patterns of neural activity appeared to be driven by specific spontaneous behaviors that the animals engaged in during the experiment. We tracked these spontaneous behaviors by projecting a video recording of the mouse face onto a set of canonical “eigenfaces” (bottom left) and used these projections to predict a large fraction of the neural activity (bottom right).                     t                     , time; PC, principal component.                                                                                            ,              Neuronal populations in sensory cortex produce variable responses to sensory stimuli and exhibit intricate spontaneous activity even without external sensory input. Cortical variability and spontaneous activity have been variously proposed to represent random noise, recall of prior experience, or encoding of ongoing behavioral and cognitive variables. Recording more than 10,000 neurons in mouse visual cortex, we observed that spontaneous activity reliably encoded a high-dimensional latent state, which was partially related to the mouse’s ongoing behavior and was represented not just in visual cortex but also across the forebrain. Sensory inputs did not interrupt this ongoing signal but added onto it a representation of external stimuli in orthogonal dimensions. Thus, visual cortical population activity, despite its apparently noisy structure, reliably encodes an orthogonal fusion of sensory and multidimensional behavioral information.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Reconstructing visual experiences from human brain activity offers a unique way to understand how the brain represents the world, and to interpret the connection between computer vision models and our visual system. While deep generative models have recently been employed for this task, reconstructing realistic images with high semantic fidelity is still a challenging problem. Here, we propose a new method based on a diffusion model (DM) to reconstruct images from human brain activity obtained via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). More specifically, we rely on a latent diffusion model (LDM) termed Stable Diffusion. This model reduces the computational cost of DMs, while preserving their high generative performance. We also characterize the inner mechanisms of the LDM by studying how its different components (such as the latent vector of image Z, conditioning inputs C, and different elements of the denoising U-Net) relate to distinct brain functions. We show that our proposed method can reconstruct high-resolution images with high fidelity in straight-forward fashion, without the need for any additional training and fine-tuning of complex deep-learning models. We also provide a quantitative interpretation of different LDM components from a neuroscientific perspective. Overall, our study proposes a promising method for reconstructing images from human brain activity, and provides a new framework for understanding DMs. Please check out our webpage at             https://sites.google.com/view/stablediffusion-with-brain/             .},

  abstract = {Geothermal energy will become an important part of energy in the future because of its advantages in source stability, sustainability, and potential high utilization ratio. In particular, the development and utilization of deep geothermal energy from HDR have gradually attracted people’s attention. Aiming at solution to the bottleneck of EGS-D, a new EGS-E based on excavation technology is proposed. In this paper, a concise and direct method for estimating the early performance of this disruptive and innovative geothermal development scheme is established as a viable alternative to supercomputing for the subsequent quantitative research of the corresponding relationship between a typical deep engineering structure and its heat extraction efficiency. Firstly, the effects of the fixed temperature at a tunnel wall, the radius of a tunnel, and the rock type on the annual heat extraction rate of the tunnel are studied based on the analytical solution of a one-dimensional radial plane problem of the transient heat conduction through high-temperature surrounding rock to the tunnel wall covering 30 years. Then, three different estimation methods of EGS-E efficiency with comb-shaped and chessboard-shaped underground tunnels, respectively, are studied, and the research ideas for the estimation of the EGS-E system with more complicated cobweb-shaped tunnels are pointed out.},

In particular, how primates navigate the multidimensional social relationships that structure daily life             4             and shape survival and reproductive success             5             remains largely unexplored at the single neuron level. Here, we combine ethological analysis with new wireless recording technologies to uncover neural signatures of natural behavior in unrestrained, socially interacting pairs of rhesus macaques. Single neuron and population activity in prefrontal and temporal cortex unveiled robust encoding of 24 species-typical behaviors, which was strongly modulated by the presence and identity of surrounding monkeys. Male-female partners demonstrated near-perfect reciprocity in grooming, a key behavioral mechanism supporting friendships and alliances             6             , and neural activity maintained a running account of these social investments. When confronted with an aggressive intruder, behavioral and neural population responses reflected empathy and were buffered by the presence of a partner. By employing an ethological approach to the study of primate neurobiology, we reveal a highly-distributed neurophysiological ledger of social dynamics, a potential computational foundation supporting communal life in primate societies, including our own.},

Using new structural materials, microfabrication, and penetration techniques, we develop a mechanically robust ultraflexible, 1 µm thin electrode array (MERF) that enables pial penetration and high‐density, large‐scale, and chronic recording of neurons along both vertical and horizontal cortical axes in the nonhuman primate brain. Recording from three monkeys yields 2,913 SUs from 1,065 functional recording channels (up to 240 days), with some SUs tracked for up to 2 months. Recording from the primary visual cortex (V1) reveals that neurons with similar orientation preferences for visual stimuli exhibited higher spike correlation. Furthermore, simultaneously recorded neurons in different cortical layers of the primary motor cortex (M1) show preferential firing for hand movements of different directions. Finally, it is shown that a linear decoder trained with neuronal spiking activity across M1 layers during monkey's hand movements can be used to achieve on‐line control of cursor movement. Thus, the MERF electrode array offers a new tool for basic neuroscience studies and brain–machine interface (BMI) applications in the primate brain.},

  abstract = {Significance             Discovering the visual features and representations used by the brain to recognize objects is a central problem in the study of vision. Recent successes in computational models of visual recognition naturally raise the question: Do computer systems and the human brain use similar or different computations? We show by combining a novel method (minimal images) and simulations that the human recognition system uses features and learning processes, which are critical for recognition, but are not used by current models. The study uses a “phase transition” phenomenon in minimal images, in which minor changes to the image have a drastic effect on its recognition. The results show fundamental limitations of current approaches and suggest directions to produce more realistic and better-performing models.           ,              Discovering the visual features and representations used by the brain to recognize objects is a central problem in the study of vision. Recently, neural network models of visual object recognition, including biological and deep network models, have shown remarkable progress and have begun to rival human performance in some challenging tasks. These models are trained on image examples and learn to extract features and representations and to use them for categorization. It remains unclear, however, whether the representations and learning processes discovered by current models are similar to those used by the human visual system. Here we show, by introducing and using minimal recognizable images, that the human visual system uses features and processes that are not used by current models and that are critical for recognition. We found by psychophysical studies that at the level of minimal recognizable images a minute change in the image can have a drastic effect on recognition, thus identifying features that are critical for the task. Simulations then showed that current models cannot explain this sensitivity to precise feature configurations and, more generally, do not learn to recognize minimal images at a human level. The role of the features shown here is revealed uniquely at the minimal level, where the contribution of each feature is essential. A full understanding of the learning and use of such features will extend our understanding of visual recognition and its cortical mechanisms and will enhance the capacity of computational models to learn from visual experience and to deal with recognition and detailed image interpretation.},

Pharmacological blockade of the nBOR by lidocaine led to a decrease or increase in visual responsiveness of rotundal cells, suggesting excitatory or inhibitory actions of the nBOR on rotundal cells. These results were confirmed by changes in the excitability of rotundal cells following electrical stimulation of the nBOR. Response latency measurements implied that there might be at least two pathways from the nBOR to the nucleus rotundus, one being a direct excitatory pathway and the other an indirect inhibitory pathway possibly mediated by the subpretectal nucleus and the interstitio-pretecto-subpretectal nucleus, which have been thought to send inhibitory afferents to the nucleus rotundus. Taken together with previous neuroanatomical and immunocytochemical studies, it is suggested that modulatory interactions might exist between the nBOR and the nRt in particular and between the accessory optic system and the tectofugal pathway in general in birds.},

In binocular vision-deprived cats, 68\% of cells recorded showed significant adaptation to prolonged grating stimuli within 30 s, with a mean response decrease of 33\%, and then stabilized gradually. This adaptation was stronger than that of relay cells in normal cats. In monocular vision-deprived cats, 53\% of the cells driven by the deprived eye showed similar adaptation as did 44\% of the cells driven by the non-deprived eye. These results indicate that pattern adaptation could be maintained or even enhanced after visual deprivation in early life. It is suggested that pattern adaptation is a general and intrinsic property of the dLGN cells, which may be mainly determined by genetic factors.},

However, a growing number of recent findings have placed this standard model under strain. We now draw on recent advances in artificial intelligence to introduce a new theory of reward-based learning. Here, the dopamine system trains another part of the brain, the prefrontal cortex, to operate as its own free-standing learning system. This new perspective accommodates the findings that motivated the standard model, but also deals gracefully with a wider range of observations, providing a fresh foundation for future research.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The evolution of neural activity during a perceptual decision is well characterized by the evidence parameter in sequential sampling models. However, it is not known whether accumulating signals in human neuroimaging are related to the integration of evidence. Our aim was to determine whether activity accumulates in a nonperceptual task by identifying brain regions tracking the strength of probabilistic evidence. fMRI was used to measure whole-brain activity as choices were informed by integrating a series of learned prior probabilities. Participants first learned the predictive relationship between a set of shape stimuli and one of two choices. During scanned testing, they made binary choices informed by the sum of the predictive strengths of individual shapes. Sequences of shapes adhered to three distinct rates of evidence (RoEs): rapid, gradual, and switch. We predicted that activity in regions informing the decision would modulate as a function of RoE prior to the choice. Activity in some regions, including premotor areas, changed as a function of RoE and response hand, indicating a role in forming an intention to respond. Regions in occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes modulated as a function of RoE only, suggesting a preresponse stage of evidence processing. In all of these regions, activity was greatest on rapid trials and least on switch trials, which is consistent with an accumulation-to-boundary account. In contrast, activity in a set of frontal and parietal regions was greatest on switch and least on rapid trials, which is consistent with an effort or time-on-task account.},

  abstract = {1. Single-cell recordings were made in the magnocellular layer of the dorsal lateral genicule nucleus (dLGN) of five adult cats in which prenatal binocular interactions were interrupted by monocular enucleation at known gestational ages. Three cats (early enucleates) had one eye removed on either embryonic day 44.48, or 49, before retinogeniculate inputs are segregated into uniocular layers. Two other (late enucleates) underwent this procedure on embryonic days 55 and 58, when segregation is well advanced. Responses were compared with those obtained from recordings in the A and A1 layers of the dLGN of seven normal adult cats. 2. Cells were classified as ON or OFF by the use of spots of light and as X or Y based on a test of linearity of spatial summation with the use of counterphased sinusoidal gratings. Receptive-field size and spatial resolution were also obtained. 3. The dLGN of prenatally enucleated cats contains a dorsal magnocellular layer and a ventral parvocellular layer. In early enucleates, only an occasional hint of a cell-sparse interlaminar zone was apparent, located between the magnocellular and parvocellular layers. In late enucleates, a prominent cell-sparse band was observed contralateral to the remaining eye, in a region that would most likely correspond to layer A1 in the normal dLGN. No such cell-sparse band was seen ipsilateral to the remaining eye in late enucleates. 4. Eighty-six X cells and 22 Y cells were studied in the enucleates. Both cell types were found at all depths of the magnocellular layer. All but a few neurons had concentric ON-center or OFF-center receptive fields that were normal in size. The topography of receptive fields also appeared normal. In addition, spatial resolution of X and Y cells was similar in experimental and control animals. 5. In early enucleates there was a higher percentage of X cells and a lower percentage of Y cells than normal. The change in X-to-Y ratio was shown to be because of both a gain in cells with X properties and a loss of cells with Y properties. The distribution of dLGN somal sizes in the early enucleates was comparable with controls, so the change in X-to-Y ratio most likely did not result from an electrode sampling bias. It was suggested that the X-to-Y ratio difference could stem from the abnormalities in retinogeniculate terminal arbors that have been shown to follow early eye removal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The present study shows that stimulation beyond the receptive field does not contribute to the visual responses of neurons in the nucleus lentiformis mesencephali in two respects. First, changes in the direction and velocity of motion beyond the receptive field did not affect the visual responses of the pretectal cells to motion within the receptive field. Second, time differences in the onset of stimulation within and outside the receptive field did not influence the visual responses of the pretectal cells to motion in the receptive field, implying that there may be no long-range interaction between the receptive field and its surrounding field. The present study also indicates that the pretectal cells are not only sensitive to the direction and velocity of motion, but also to the size and density of dots in a random-dot pattern moving through the receptive field. Taken together with previous studies, these results suggest that the receptive field of the pretectal cells within the nucleus lentiformis mesencephali is large in size but well defined in boundaries, and that the pretectal cells respond to motion of visual stimuli within but not beyond their receptive fields.},

The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been suggested to encode value during value-based decision making. Yet it is not known how its activity is modulated by attention shifts. We investigated this question by employing a passive viewing task that allowed us to disentangle effects of attention, value, choice and eye movement. We found that the attention modulated OFC activity through a winner-take-all mechanism. When we attracted the monkeys’ attention covertly, the OFC neuronal activity reflected the reward value of the newly attended cue. The shift of attention could be explained by a normalization model. Our results strongly argue for the hypothesis that the OFC neuronal activity represents the value of the attended item. They provide important insights toward understanding the OFC’s role in value-based decision making.},

We investigated the neural code underlying sequence working memory using two-photon calcium imaging to record thousands of neurons in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys memorizing and then reproducing a sequence of locations after a delay. We discovered a regular geometrical organization: The high-dimensional neural state space during the delay could be decomposed into a sum of low-dimensional subspaces, each storing the spatial location at a given ordinal rank, which could be generalized to novel sequences and explain monkey behavior. The rank subspaces were distributed across large overlapping neural groups, and the integration of ordinal and spatial information occurred at the collective level rather than within single neurons. Thus, a simple representational geometry underlies sequence working memory.           ,              How to remember a sequence of events                            How is serial order mentally encoded and stored in memory? Xie               et al               . addressed this question using two-photon calcium imaging to simultaneously record thousands of prefrontal neurons in monkeys performing a delayed visuospatial sequence reproduction task. The animals saw a sequence of three locations and, after a delay, made a saccade to the corresponding locations in the appropriate order. The data obtained using a mathematical decomposition technique support a new and simple type of model: a static population code with distinct and near-orthogonal subspaces for each rank in the sequence, all superimposed in the same overlapping groups of prefrontal neurons. These results open an important and new perspective on understanding sequence representations in the brain. —PRS                        ,              Calcium imaging shows the representation of spatial working memory in primate lateral prefrontal cortex.},

  abstract = {Purpose. The purpose of this paper is to solve the scientific problem that the classical diffusion model in columnar coal cores cannot accurately describe the whole process of gas diffusion.        Methods. The diffusion-percolation experiments were carried out using the laboratory’s homemade experimental equipment with standard ϕ 50mm×100 mm columnar raw coal cores under different air pressures.        Findings. The classical diffusion model was used to fit the experimental data. The experiment has found that the classical diffusion model of the columnar coal core can only partially describe the gas diffusion process. The longer the experimental time, the larger the error between the model and the experiment, and the analysis has found that the apparent diffusion coefficient shows decay changes with time. The dynamic diffusion coefficient concept is then proposed in order to con-struct a radial multi-scale dynamic prominent diffusion-percolation model for columnar coal cores. The theoretical curve of the new model nearly coincides with the experimental curve, and the new model can describe the gas diffusion-percolation process of columnar coal cores more accurately. The multi-scale dynamic diffusion-percolation model covers the classical diffusion model. It explains the mechanism of gas diffusion-percolation in multi-scale pores, i.e., at the beginning of the flow, gas flows out from the large external pores first, from the surface inwards. Over time, the pore size through which gas flows gradually becomes smaller, the diffusion resistance gradually increases, and the apparent diffusion coefficient slowly decreases.        Originality. This paper proposes a new multi-scale dynamic diffusion-percolation model to compare the old and new model analysis, as well as carefully studying the mechanism of gas flow in coal.        Practical implications. This research has important engineering significance for the accuracy of measuring the gas content of coal seams, as well as predicting coal and gas content.}

In both areas, vestibular signals are head-centered, whereas visual signals are mainly eye-centered. However, visual signals in FEFsem are more shifted towards the head coordinate compared to MSTd. These results are robust being largely independent on: (1) smooth pursuit eye movement, (2) motion parallax cue, and (3) behavioral context for active heading estimation, indicating that the visual and vestibular heading signals may be represented in distinct spatial coordinate in sensory cortices.},

The ability to use heuristic strategies demands an advanced level of intelligence and has not been demonstrated in animals. Here, we trained macaque monkeys to play the classic video game Pac-Man. The monkeys’ decision-making may be described with a strategy-based hierarchical decision-making model with over 90\% accuracy. The model reveals that the monkeys adopted the take-the-best heuristic by using one dominating strategy for their decision-making at a time and formed compound strategies by assembling the basis strategies to handle particular game situations. With the model, the computationally complex but fully quantifiable Pac-Man behavior paradigm provides a new approach to understanding animals’ advanced cognition.},

  abstract = {Abstract           Equiluminant stimuli help assess the integrity of colour perception and the relationship of colour to other visual features. As a result of individual variation, it is necessary to calibrate experimental visual stimuli to suit each individual’s unique equiluminant ratio. Most traditional methods rely on training observers to report their subjective equiluminance point. Such paradigms cannot easily be implemented on pre-verbal or non-verbal observers. One alternative, optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) of the eye in response to motion, is partially compromised by recent observations that changes in attentional fixation affect the OKN. Here, we present a novel Pupil Frequency-Tagging Method (PFTM) for detecting a participant’s unique equiluminance point without verbal instruction and with minimal training. PFTM analyses reflexive pupil oscillations induced by slow ({$<$} 2 Hz) temporal alternations between coloured stimuli. Two equiluminant stimuli will induce a similar pupil dilation response regardless of colour; therefore, an observer’s equiluminant point can be identified as the luminance ratio between two colours for which the oscillatory amplitude of the pupil at the tagged frequency is minimal. We compared pupillometry-based equiluminance ratios to those obtained with two established techniques in humans: minimum flicker and minimum motion. In addition, we estimated the equiluminance point in non-human primates, demonstrating that this new technique can be successfully employed in non-verbal subjects.},

  abstract = {Primates need to detect and recognize camouflaged animals in natural environments. Camouflage-breaking movements are often the only visual cue available to accomplish this. Specifically, sudden movements are often detected before full recognition of the camouflaged animal is made, suggesting that initial processing of motion precedes the recognition of motion-defined contours or shapes. What are the neuronal mechanisms underlying this initial processing of camouflaged motion in the primate visual brain? We investigated this question using intrinsic-signal optical imaging of macaque V1, V2 and V4, along with computer simulations of the neural population responses. We found that camouflaged motion at low speed was processed as a direction signal by both direction- and orientation-selective neurons, whereas at high-speed camouflaged motion was encoded as a motion-streak signal primarily by orientation-selective neurons. No population responses were found to be invariant to the camouflage contours. These results suggest that the initial processing of camouflaged motion at low and high speeds is encoded as direction and motion-streak signals in primate early visual cortices. These processes are consistent with a spatio-temporal filter mechanism that provides for fast processing of motion signals, prior to full recognition of camouflage-breaking animals.},

Here, we combined choice-correlation measures and electrical microstimulation on a site-to-site basis in the medial superior temporal area (MST), middle temporal area (MT), and ventral intraparietal area (VIP) when macaques discriminated between motion directions in both fine and coarse tasks. Microstimulation generated comparable effects between tasks but heterogeneous effects across and within brain regions. Within the MST and MT, microstimulation significantly biased an animal’s choice toward the sensory preference instead of choicerelated signals of the stimulated units. This was particularly evident for sites with conflict preference of sensory and choice-related signals. In the VIP, microstimulation failed to produce significant effects in either task despite strong choice correlations presented in this area. Our results suggest that sensory readout may not be inferred from choice-related signals during perceptual decision-making tasks.},

The sensory cues from the same stimulus should be integrated to improve perception, and otherwise segregated to distinguish different stimuli. In reality, however, the brain faces the challenge of recognizing stimuli without knowing in advance the sources of sensory cues. To address this challenge, we propose that the brain conducts integration and segregation concurrently with complementary neurons. Studying the inference of heading-direction via visual and vestibular cues, we develop a network model with two reciprocally connected modules modeling interacting visual-vestibular areas. In each module, there are two groups of neurons whose tunings under each sensory cue are either congruent or opposite. We show that congruent neurons implement integration, while opposite neurons compute cue disparity information for segregation, and the interplay between two groups of neurons achieves efficient multisensory information processing.},

  abstract = {How multiple sensory cues are integrated in neural circuitry remains a challenge. The common hypothesis is that information integration might be accomplished in a dedicated multisensory integration area receiving feedforward inputs from the modalities. However, recent experimental evidence suggests that it is not a single multisensory brain area, but rather many multisensory brain areas that are simultaneously involved in the integration of information. Why many mutually connected areas should be needed for information integration is puzzling. Here, we investigated theoretically how information integration could be achieved in a distributed fashion within a network of interconnected multisensory areas. Using biologically realistic neural network models, we developed a decentralized information integration system that comprises multiple interconnected integration areas. Studying an example of combining visual and vestibular cues to infer heading direction, we show that such a decentralized system is in good agreement with anatomical evidence and experimental observations. In particular, we show that this decentralized system can integrate information optimally. The decentralized system predicts that optimally integrated information should emerge locally from the dynamics of the communication between brain areas and sheds new light on the interpretation of the connectivity between multisensory brain areas. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT To extract information reliably from ambiguous environments, the brain integrates multiple sensory cues, which provide different aspects of information about the same entity of interest. Here, we propose a decentralized architecture for multisensory integration. In such a system, no processor is in the center of the network topology and information integration is achieved in a distributed manner through reciprocally connected local processors. Through studying the inference of heading direction with visual and vestibular cues, we show that the decentralized system can integrate information optimally, with the reciprocal connections between processers determining the extent of cue integration. Our model reproduces known multisensory integration behaviors observed in experiments and sheds new light on our understanding of how information is integrated in the brain.},

Yet, it has not been identified where exactly the accumulation originates. We reason that a candidate brain area should both represent evidence accumulation and information that is used to compute evidence. Therefore, we designed a two-stage probabilistic reasoning task in which the evidence for accumulation had to be first determined from sensory signals orthogonal to decisions. With a linear encoding model, we decomposed the responses of posterior parietal neurons to each stimulus into an early and a late component that represented two dissociable stages of decision making. The former reflected the transformation from sensory inputs to accumulable evidence, and the latter reflected the accumulation of evidence and the formation of decisions. The presence of both computational stages indicates that evidence accumulation signal in the parietal cortex is computed locally.},

  abstract = {The brain makes flexible and adaptive responses in a complicated and ever-changing environment for an organism’s survival. To achieve this, the brain needs to understand the contingencies between its sensory inputs, actions, and rewards. This is analogous to the statistical inference that has been extensively studied in the natural language processing field, where recent developments of recurrent neural networks have found many successes. We wonder whether these neural networks, the gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks in particular, reflect how the brain solves the contingency problem. Therefore, we build a GRU network framework inspired by the statistical learning approach of NLP and test it with four exemplar behavior tasks previously used in empirical studies. The network models are trained to predict future events based on past events, both comprising sensory, action, and reward events. We show the networks can successfully reproduce animal and human behavior. The networks generalize the training, perform Bayesian inference in novel conditions, and adapt their choices when event contingencies vary. Importantly, units in the network encode task variables and exhibit activity patterns that match previous neurophysiology findings. Our results suggest that the neural network approach based on statistical sequence learning may reflect the brain’s computational principle underlying flexible and adaptive behaviors and serve as a useful approach to understand the brain.},

  abstract = {The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encodes value and plays a key role in value-based decision-making. However, the attentional modulation of the OFC’s value encoding is poorly understood. We trained two monkeys to detect a luminance change at a cued location between a pair of visual stimuli, which were over-trained pictures associated with different amounts of juice reward and, thus, different reward salience. Both the monkeys’ behavior and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex neuronal activities indicated that the monkeys actively directed their spatial attention toward the cued stimulus during the task. However, the OFC’s neuronal responses were dominated by the stimulus with higher reward salience and encoded its value. The value of the less salient stimulus was only weakly represented regardless of spatial attention. The results demonstrate that reward and spatial attention are distinctly represented in the prefrontal cortex and the OFC maintains a stable representation of reward salience minimally affected by attention.},

  abstract = {Multisensory processing is of vital importance for survival in the external world. Brain circuits can both integrate and separate visual and vestibular senses to infer self-motion and the motion of other objects. However, it is largely debated how multisensory brain regions process such multisensory information and whether they follow the Bayesian strategy in this process. Here, we combined macaque physiological recordings in the dorsal medial superior temporal area (MST-d) with modeling of synaptically coupled multilayer continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs) to study the underlying neuronal circuit mechanisms. In contrast to previous theoretical studies that focused on unisensory direction preference, our analysis showed that synaptic coupling induced cooperation and competition in the multisensory circuit and caused single MST-d neurons to switch between sensory integration or separation modes based on the fixed-criterion causal strategy, which is determined by the synaptic coupling strength. Furthermore, the prior of sensory reliability was represented by pooling diversified criteria at the MST-d population level, and the Bayesian strategy was achieved in downstream neurons whose causal inference flexibly changed with the prior. The CANN model also showed that synaptic input balance is the dynamic origin of neuronal direction preference formation and further explained the misalignment between direction preference and inference observed in previous studies. This work provides a computational framework for a new brain-inspired algorithm underlying multisensory computation.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Accurate self-motion perception, which is critical for organisms to survive, is a process involving multiple sensory cues. The two most powerful cues are visual (optic flow) and vestibular (inertial motion). Psychophysical studies have indicated that humans and nonhuman primates integrate the two cues to improve the estimation of self-motion direction, often in a statistically Bayesian-optimal way. In the last decade, single-unit recordings in awake, behaving animals have provided valuable neurophysiological data with a high spatial and temporal resolution, giving insight into possible neural mechanisms underlying multisensory self-motion perception. Here, we review these findings, along with new evidence from the most recent studies focusing on the temporal dynamics of signals in different modalities. We show that, in light of new data, conventional thoughts about the cortical mechanisms underlying visuo-vestibular integration for linear self-motion are challenged. We propose that different temporal component signals may mediate different functions, a possibility that requires future studies.},

  abstract = {Significance             The brain generates increasingly complex representations of the visual world to recognize objects, to form new memories, and to organize visual behavior. Relatively simple signals in the retina are transformed through a cascade of neural computations into highly complex responses in visual cortical areas deep in the temporal lobe. The representations of visual signals in areas that lie in the middle of this cascade remain poorly understood, yet they are critical to understanding how the cascade operates. Here, we demonstrate changes in the representation of visual information from area V1 to V2, and show how these changes extract and represent information about the local statistical features of visual images.           ,              As information propagates along the ventral visual hierarchy, neuronal responses become both more specific for particular image features and more tolerant of image transformations that preserve those features. Here, we present evidence that neurons in area V2 are selective for local statistics that occur in natural visual textures, and tolerant of manipulations that preserve these statistics. Texture stimuli were generated by sampling from a statistical model, with parameters chosen to match the parameters of a set of visually distinct natural texture images. Stimuli generated with the same statistics are perceptually similar to each other despite differences, arising from the sampling process, in the precise spatial location of features. We assessed the accuracy with which these textures could be classified based on the responses of V1 and V2 neurons recorded individually in anesthetized macaque monkeys. We also assessed the accuracy with which particular samples could be identified, relative to other statistically matched samples. For populations of up to 100 cells, V1 neurons supported better performance in the sample identification task, whereas V2 neurons exhibited better performance in texture classification. Relative to V1, the responses of V2 show greater selectivity and tolerance for the representation of texture statistics.},
