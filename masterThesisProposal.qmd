## Proposal background and significance

In the progress made in trying to understand sensory area that process visual infomation, decades of work have elaborated a model in which the main task of sensory area is to integrate classes of data, into invariant representations ([@fig-classSensormotor] *a, b*). This model suggested these discrete "filters" such as lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortical area V1 attempt to provide veridical representations of their local sensory inputs[@carandiniWeKnowWhat2005; @morganFeaturesPrimalSketch2011].This model suggested these discrete "filters" such as lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortical area V1 attempt to provide veridical representations of their local sensory inputs[@carandiniWeKnowWhat2005; @morganFeaturesPrimalSketch2011]. The previous work has shown a substantial range of spatial and temporal effects of feedback[@wangFunctionalAlignmentFeedback2006; @wangFocalGainControl2016a; @andolinaCorticothalamicFeedbackEnhances2007; @andolinaEffectsCorticalFeedback2013; @jonesDifferentialFeedbackModulation2012; @jonesResponsesPrimateLGN2013; @saltPotentiationSensoryResponses2012; @sillitoAlwaysReturningFeedback2006; @gilbertTopdownInfluencesVisual2013; @angelucciCircuitsMechanismsSurround2017]. Recently, there is evidence of incoming sensory infomation not only being modulated by spatio-temporal modulation but also having a board range of high-level extra-classical input to early visual areas. This input enable neurons with focal classic receptive fields to be driven by factors such as the task relevant context of their visual surroundings, saccade, motor activity, other sensory modalities like hearing and and the cognitive demands of ongoing behavioural tasks[@saalmannCognitivePerceptualFunctions2011; @gilbertTopdownInfluencesVisual2013; @petroContributionsCorticalFeedback2014; @fregnacCorticalCorrelatesLowLevel2015; @phillipsFunctionsMechanismsMalfunctions2015]. The implicit assumption of this theory is that in primary visual areas such as V1 the connections from the LGN shoud dominate. However, in real biological networks the numbers of feedforward inputs from senses are numerically dwarfed by intrinsic connections from within the brain itself[@fellemanDistributedHierarchicalProcessing1991a; @markovWeightConsistencySpecifies2011]. This sample fact contradicts the tranditional sensorimotor loop model([@fig-classSensormotor] *a, b*). These conflicts raise new questions and challenges.

In fig a & b there is a classic sensorimotor loop. Environment state [***W~1~***] stimulates sensors and then sensory areas [***S~1~***] processes the input stimulation from sensors and feeds forward to a decision making controller [***C~1~***], which goals is to reliably accumulate evidence for the most "probable" external state [***W~1~***], with which it subsequently guides motor preparation and action [***A~1~***]. This repositions the agent relative to the world and a new loop of activity begins [w~2~→s~2~→c~2~→a~2~] etc.
